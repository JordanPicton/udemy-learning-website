        which is where they use a div to wrap the content I'd want with the container class however, I can also just put it into the class parameter of the different elements I want to have this class too. Resziing also shows that this is responsive too. -->

            <h2>What Is Bootstrap?</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap selfproclaims that it is "The worlds most popular CSS framework." What this means is that
                bootstrap lays down the building blocks in which I can use within my webpage. Basically saying I can use
                Bootstraps CSS instead of making my own. (I really want to look into how they make the navigation bars
                work.) It's also good for being responsive. Think of it as a pre-made CSS library to styling different
                things. All I would have to do is write out lets say a button and then include the bootstrap styling for
                that button via a class name and that's it, the button would use bootstraps already made styling for the
                button with me just needing to import it like other style sheets and then setting the class name to the
                element with what style I want to use. It's important to understand that I shouldn't be relying on
                bootstrap for everything but it is good to know how to use it and what it can do. </p>
            <p>Some other frameworks are as follows: Foundation, Semantic UI etc.</p>

        <section class="boot-grid container">
            <h2>Bootstrap Grid</h2>
            <p>With Bootstrap you can layout your content using the Grid they provide. Particular classes used help in
                the way of creating different areas on a webpage. This seems like it is done using divs. However, I feel
                like I would rather do this myself so then I have more control over this.</p>
