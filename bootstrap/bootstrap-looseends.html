        <h1 class="display-1">Bootstrap Loose Ends</h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                So with this section it's all about the few parts of Bootstrap that didn't really get covered but can
                come in handy to know. These are listed under the components section within Bootstrap.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-2">Cards</h2>
            <p>
                Cards are generic but commonly used content containers where they can be mixed and matched generally
                within the grid system. For example a grid of cards is most commonly found on a gallary website, where
                it would contain an image, a title and then a brief description. There's lots of stuff to do with them,
                they're very flexible. A good way Colt said it was it's a box with a border and some special pieces
                within it.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-2">Carousel</h2>
            <p>
                Carousels are a selection of images that can loop through, almost like a slideshow, they can be made
                with or without controls, also with indicators to show which image the user is on and to show the amount
                of images there are. A fade and slide effect can be added to this. However, behind the scenes this kind
                of thing requires a lot of Javascript. Which I am eager to get into very shortly here.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-2">Drop Down Menus</h2>
            <p>
                Something I've been trying to learn myself is drop down menus, though I believe learning to do these
                with Javascript would make more sense to me a there's a little Javascript that is useful for navbars
                with drop downs. There's a few tests I have on my Github about this and there's a few more I want to try
                out before starting again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also I didn't know this but the menus can go upwards and sideways depending on the use case, so for
                example instead of going down they can go up or drop down from the side instead of directly below.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-2">Spinners</h2>
            <p>
                These are not essential but they're nice to know about, there's a growing spinner and then a spinner
                border which is basically like a loading icon.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-2">Progress</h2>
            <p>
                There's also progress bars, I'd really like to add these to my website to show how much I've completed
                of X project, but also maybe for the website itself in the sense of how complete the website actually
                is.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-2">Modals</h2>
            <p>
                If I recall correctly these are the newer way in doing popups or something. But that's what these are,
                they're popups. Very useful for bringing attention to the user when something important is happening.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-2">The End Of Bootstrap Section</h2>
            <p>
                Okay that's it I'm moving onto my next section which is my project, which I'm assuming uses Bootstrap.
                Either way, I've always heard of bootsrap but never knew what it actually was or was used for, knowing
                how to use it and how to deal with it makes things way easier and actually helpful in a way. I'll be
                looking to use this for a website just using Bootstrap in the near future.
