                So with the video I'm learning from with Colt, these are apparently newer for when he made the video,
                they're in alpha from that point. For me though they're out of alpha and beta meaning they're fully
                implemented I'm assuming from their docs and website. It's basically a free set of icons I can use from
                bootstrap instead of using another library like flaticons or downloading them and implementing them with
                image elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to note is that when using these icons, the colours can be changed. And apparently it's
                similar to image elements but they're called svg and seem to have a lot more settings for them which is
                scary but also interesting. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It seems like I can install these
                icons locally if I really wanted to and just use the i element over any of the img or svg elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the example below, I can position it differently along with change the font size. By looking at the
                code below I can see that the svg has a size of 16 being height and width are set to 16 but I'm not 100%
                sure what that really means. The default code that is used with the svg element has the width and height
                set to 16. I've found out that using 1em for the sizing works better for me personally. Also someone
                replied to my question about the svg being only set to 16 and not something like 16% or 16px etc. Turns
                out it probably just means pixels (px).

                A common place to use icons would be something like inputs for a form, for example the @ symbol and some
                others like dollar sign etc. I feel like for my main project however, I'll be using a lot of the
                download symbol. They can be used for a search field, I'll be making an example of this below.
            </p>
            <p>
                It starts off with a div with a class of "input-group" with another div inside with the class of
                "input-group-prepend" which darkens the section that the icon is inside of, showing the user they can't
                type there. Along with prepend meaning it starts at the beginning and append being towards the end.
                After this there's a span element with the class name of "input-group-text" nested inside that div. Then
                after this there's the actual input element, which is nested withing the input-group div.
            </p>
            <p>
                The row and col divs don't really matter here since it will be styled properly when actually used on a
                website, this is just to make it look slightly nicer for right now. As by default it spans across the
                entire page. The example below doesn't really look the best but when I'm doing my website project that
                is built with bootstrap I'll look more into this and read the docs for the version I'm using at the time
                a little more properly since I'm following a guide on an older version.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are other icon libraries out there, such a Font Awesome or Flaticon. They can have way more icons
                and a lot more features, there are paid ones which mak sense but they also allow us to change the
                colours there and then etc. Bootstrap Icons are still worth using however.
            </p>
            <p>
                SVG's are Scalable Vector Graphics, copy, paste and they kind of behave like text within the website.
