                So with the video I'm learning from with Colt, these are apparently newer for when he made the video,
                they're in alpha from that point. For me though they're out of alpha and beta meaning they're fully
                implemented I'm assuming from their docs and website. It's basically a free set of icons I can use from
                bootstrap instead of using another library like flaticons or downloading them and implementing them with
                image elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to note is that when using these icons, the colours can be changed. And apparently it's
                similar to image elements but they're called svg and seem to have a lot more settings for them which is
                scary but also interesting. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It seems like I can install these
                icons locally if I really wanted to and just use the i element over any of the img or svg elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the example below, I can position it differently along with change the font size. By looking at the
                code below I can see that the svg has a size of 16 being height and width are set to 16 but I'm not 100%
                sure what that really means. The default code that is used with the svg element has the width and height
                set to 16. I've found out that using 1em for the sizing works better for me personally.
