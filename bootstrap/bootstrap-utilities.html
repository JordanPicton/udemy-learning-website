        <section>
            <h2 class="display-2">Border Utilities</h2>
            <p>
                These are not individual components, these will be a set of utilities that might not seem to make a huge
                impact right away. But they do make a difference over time, I've used some of them already and they're
                just quick ways of applying some CSS styles like turning borders on or off, adding border radius,
                changing display property, adding margin. Bootstrap allows me to do this via singular classes.
            </p>
            <p class="border">
                The first thing I'll be looking at is the border utility, I'll be using this paragraph as my test. There
                are five different border classes being, "border" (all sides), "border-top", "border-end",
                "border-bottom", and "border-start". The thing I can't control is the width through bootstrap. I can
                either set a width I'd like to have or use the default. For this example I'll use the default and look
                into maybe setting one.
            </p>
            <p class="border border-top-0">
                There's another class that allows me to remove a border, this sounds like it would be useful if I wanted
                a full border on an element but wanted one side removed. I'll test that out here in this paragraph too,
                I'll remove the top border. And the way to do this is to use a class such as "border-0" and similar
                classes used above. Worked exactly like I thought it would.
            </p>
            <p class="border border-primary">
                The next one I'm looking at is changing the border colour, which is done pretty similary to how I've
                changed the colour of other elements during learning bootstrap. And again I'll be using this paragraph
                as my example. Interestingly I need to also include the main border class for this to work it seems,
                though I suppose the class for border-&lt;colourname&gt; would be something like just "border-color:
                &lt;variablename&gt;". There's also subtle versions of these border colours that have a more mellow and
                greyed out version of the base colour. Would be useful for things like disabled buttons etc.
            </p>
            <p class="border rounded">
                A really useful one would be the border radius utility, allowing me to make different borders with a
                different radius by just using this utility rather than typing it out for different ones if they're all
                not the same. It makes circles and pill shaped borders especially easier to do. The only thing about the
                circle is that the element will need to be a square for it to work properly. The one example I have on
                this paragraph will round out the corners by using the class "rounded". For the version I'm using the
                classes are very different from what the lesson is teaching me.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="display-2">Text & Background Utility</h2>
            <p class="bg-success">
                The next utility is about text and background colours, I've used these utilities countless times before
                throughout the course of learning Bootstrap. I keep forgetting how to do text though it seems, I know
                that the class for backgrounds is as follows: "bg-&lt;colourname&gt;". There seems to be another type of
                colour class I can use which turns the base colour into a more pastel lighter colour and the class looks
                like: "bg-&lt;colourname&gt;-emphasis".
            </p>
            <p class="text-warning">
                I found out how to do text and it's very easy, which makes me slightly laugh since it's what I should
                have expected honestly. The way the classes start is basically this "text-&lt;colourname&gt;". I'll
                apply it to this paragraph for an example, I'll use the colour for warning.
            </p>
            <p class="border shadow">
                Something else I can do that is part of the background, kind of. Is adding a shadow to an element, for
                example I can add a box-shadow to this paragraph. There's classes for this being; "shadow-none",
                "shadow-sm", "shadow", and "shadow-lg". I'll explain them a little using the same order, the first one
                just doesn't have a shadow or can remove a shadow from an element if something else is giving it a
                shadow. Secondly this one makes the shadow not as spread as much. The third one is the default for a box
                shadow. And finally the last one is a larger shadow. I'm going to add a normal box shadow to this
                paragraph. Along with a border to make it more readable. I'll be redoing this course at somepoint as an
                actual website so it's nicer for me to read things.

            <h2 class="display-2">Spacing Utility</h2>
            <p>
                Now moving onto spacing, this mainly includes stuff like the margin and padding, there's a lot to this
                it seems, there's a bunch of letters and stuff for different options. Something to make this easier to
                understand is knowing this formula {property}{sides}-{size} using this formula it's default setting is
                set to the xs breakpoint. To use the other breakpoints there is another formula that can be used being;
                {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}.
            </p>
            <h3 class="display-3">Spacing Properties</h3>
            <p>
                There's only a few options for the properties within the Spacing section, they're two of the more
                straight forward properties. To begin there is "m" which is for maring and then "p" which is for
                padding. So these two are pretty easy in a sense honestly but then again Bootstrap is like CSS, I'm not
                required to remember everything, I can always look up how something works etc.
            </p>
            <h3 class="display-3">Spacing Sides</h3>
            <p>
                For the sides section of spacing there's a lot more to do here. There's 7 different options for this
                section, one of them being "blank" aka just not filled in. I'm not going to write down what everyone of
                them does, mainly because I can just go to the docs and find out from reading the docs. So I'll just
                leave a link to them <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/">here</a> for this
                specifically. Honestly reading the docs for the version being used at the time is the best way to do
                this.
            </p>
            <p>
                It just allows me to either add marign to all sides or some of the sides to one slide, just depends on
                what I'm needing for that specific element or use case.
            </p>
            <h3 class="display-3">Spacing Sizes</h3>
            <p>
                Moving onto the different sizes that goes with the spacing properties, there is basically the same
                amount of these compared to the last section. However, what this does is either removes the margin or
                padding in some cases or will times the spacer by something. For example "0" would mean that it would
                set the margin or padding to nothing = removing the specified one. Then with 1 it would times the margin
                or padding by 0.25, continuing with 2 = 0.5, 3 = 1, 4 = 1.5 and finally 5 = 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below I'll be showing off the different paddings with different settings, first is the different sizes.
            </p>
            <div>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-0">Padding 0</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-1">Padding 1</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-2">Padding 2</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-3">Padding 3</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-4">Padding 4</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-5">Padding 5</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                And below they all have a padding of 0 and then a specific side of padding like top, left, right etc.
                I've also added a class to the div below to show how to add margin with the ultilities provided. I've
                given it the value of 5. "mt" is margin top but I can use y for both top and bottom. There's a bunch of
                options listed <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <div class="mt-5">
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-0 pt-5">Padding Top</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-0 pl-5">Padding Left</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-0 pb-5">Padding Bottom</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-0 pr-5">Padding Right</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-0 px-5">Padding X Axis</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary p-0 py-5">Padding Y Axis</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                There's also more that can be added onto this to make it even more confusing, this is done by adding in
                the breakpoint. So then it would look something like, {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}, just to
                make it that more configurable. An example is shown below;
            </p>
            <button class="btn btn-danger p-0 p-sm-1 p-md-2 p-lg-3 p-xl-5">I change!</button>
            <p>
                The example above has padding on all sizes that is set to 0 and then padding on small and above screen
                sizes are set to padding of 1. Then continuing with md at 2, lg at 3 and xl at 5. Making the button
                increase or decrease it's padding based on the screen size.
            </p>
            <h3 class="display-3">Display Properties</h3>
            <p>
                There's a bunch of useful display properties that can be used, for example making something inline,
                block, flex etc. But it's also useful for making something have a display of none, making it not show up
                at all. "d-none" will hide an element, but this can also be done responsively, for example using
                "d-sm-none" will hide the element on small and above screens.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a lot of ultilities regarding Bootstrap and I'll have to mess around them a little more when I
                get around to making the bootstrap website.
