            <h2 class="display-2">Border Utilities</h2>
            <p>
                These are not individual components, these will be a set of utilities that might not seem to make a huge
                impact right away. But they do make a difference over time, I've used some of them already and they're
                just quick ways of applying some CSS styles like turning borders on or off, adding border radius,
                changing display property, adding margin. Bootstrap allows me to do this via singular classes.
            </p>
            <p class="border">
                The first thing I'll be looking at is the border utility, I'll be using this paragraph as my test. There
                are five different border classes being, "border" (all sides), "border-top", "border-end",
                "border-bottom", and "border-start". The thing I can't control is the width through bootstrap. I can
                either set a width I'd like to have or use the default. For this example I'll use the default and look
                into maybe setting one.
            </p>
            <p class="border border-top-0">
                There's another class that allows me to remove a border, this sounds like it would be useful if I wanted
                a full border on an element but wanted one side removed. I'll test that out here in this paragraph too,
                I'll remove the top border. And the way to do this is to use a class such as "border-0" and similar
                classes used above. Worked exactly like I thought it would.
            </p>
            <p class="border border-primary">
                The next one I'm looking at is changing the border colour, which is done pretty similary to how I've
                changed the colour of other elements during learning bootstrap. And again I'll be using this paragraph
                as my example. Interestingly I need to also include the main border class for this to work it seems,
                though I suppose the class for border-&lt;colourname&gt; would be something like just "border-color:
                &lt;variablename&gt;". There's also subtle versions of these border colours that have a more mellow and
                greyed out version of the base colour. Would be useful for things like disabled buttons etc.
            </p>
            <p class="border rounded">
                A really useful one would be the border radius utility, allowing me to make different borders with a
                different radius by just using this utility rather than typing it out for different ones if they're all
                not the same. It makes circles and pill shaped borders especially easier to do. The only thing about the
                circle is that the element will need to be a square for it to work properly. The one example I have on
                this paragraph will round out the corners by using the class "rounded". For the version I'm using the
                classes are very different from what the lesson is teaching me.

        <section>
            <h2 class="display-2">Text & Background Utility</h2>
            <p class="bg-success">
                The next utility is about text and background colours, I've used these utilities countless times before
                throughout the course of learning Bootstrap. I keep forgetting how to do text though it seems, I know
                that the class for backgrounds is as follows: "bg-&lt;colourname&gt;". There seems to be another type of
                colour class I can use which turns the base colour into a more pastel lighter colour and the class looks
                like: "bg-&lt;colourname&gt;-emphasis".
            </p>
            <p class="text-warning">
                I found out how to do text and it's very easy, which makes me slightly laugh since it's what I should
                have expected honestly. The way the classes start is basically this "text-&lt;colourname&gt;". I'll
                apply it to this paragraph for an example, I'll use the colour for warning.
