   <section class="container">
      <p>
         Moving on to forms, they can be annoying to style but hopefully with Bootstrap this will be made easier. The
         first core component or class I need to know is called "form-control". This class is what goes on the input
         element of the forms, what this does is give a nicer looking form input. There's another class called
         "form-group", which basically groups together a form and a label. It doesn't do a whole bunch but it just
         groups these two together.
      </p>
      <p>
         Below I have a form, the Name input doesn't have the "form-control" class but the email does and it looks a lot
         nicer than first one. "form-control" can be used on other inputs like select, multiple select and textarea.

   <div class="container">
      <form action="#nowhere">
         <div class="form-group">
            <label for="text">Name</label>
            <input type="text">
         </div>
         <div class="form-group">
            <label for="email">Email</label>
            <input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" placeholder="email@email.com">
         </div>
         <div class="form-group">
            <label for="country">Country</label>
            <select name="country" id="country" class="form-control">
               <option value="UK">UK</option>
               <option value="Wales">Wales</option>
               <option value="Scotland">Scotland</option>
               <option value="Ireland">Ireland</option>
            </select>
         </div>
      </form>
   </div>

   <section class="container">
      <p>
         There's also ways of making inputs bigger or smaller by using classes such as "form-control-lg" or
         "form-control-sm". Moving onto check boxes and radio buttons, these are harder to change in the way of
         appearance. There's one option that's to use the browsers default checkbox and then to use a class called
         "form-check" which does the spacing differently. The way to accomplish this is to have a default browser
         checkbox that is hidden below another element that is styled in the way of a checkbox and they're linked.

            <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="defaultCheck1">
            <label class="form-check-label" for="defaultCheck1">Default Checkbox</label>

         The same can be done for radio buttons like I've done for the checkboxes. I'll be going over a lot of this in
         an up coming project however so I won't be spending too much time on Bootstrap as of right now. There's also
         switches which look really nice compared to the other checkboxes and radio inputs. They're apparently built
         ontop of a checkbox as well. There's also custom selects, range. There is a course that Colt does for this but
         it's for Bootstrap 4 where as this version I'm currently using is 5. So I'll probably learn it myself from the
         docs or just look up a different course or youtube.

   <h2 class="display-2 container">Form Layouts</h2>
   <section class="container">
      <p>
         Now moving onto the forms layout, this should be the last thing I go over with forms. Rather than having
         everything on it's own line, I could make it so it could look better since the form elements when using the new
         classes from bootstrap use the entirety of the parent container or at least most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
         So using the row and column classes I learned previous to this I can space out my form in a nicer looking
         fashion. I can use the normal row class however, there is a form-row class I can use instead. What it does is
         make the spacing between the form elements a little closer meaning they have less padding or margin between one
         another. Although actually, it doesn't seem like this version of Bootstrap has this anymore. What I can do for
         the username and email inputs though is move them onto their own line of space if they're on medium screens and
         above. I changed this to be large and above.
