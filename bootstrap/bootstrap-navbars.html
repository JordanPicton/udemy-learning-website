         Navigation bars, the thing I wish I knew how it worked. So navbars for me are something that I really want to
         get into and learn the ins and outs of them so I fully know how they work. Apparently the signature bootstrap
         system alongside the grid system. Like everything in Bootstrap if given the time and dedication I could build a
         Navgiation bar from scratch. I've been trying to figure out how to use different methods of learning Navigation
         bars and one of my projects is to build a site using a lot of Bootstrap. Just to get a good feel of what I can
         do with Bootstrap.
