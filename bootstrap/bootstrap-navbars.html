   <h1 class="display-1">Bootstrap Navigation Bars</h1>
   <section>
      <p>
         Navigation bars, the thing I wish I knew how it worked. So navbars for me are something that I really want to
         get into and learn the ins and outs of them so I fully know how they work. Apparently the signature bootstrap
         system alongside the grid system. Like everything in Bootstrap if given the time and dedication I could build a
         Navgiation bar from scratch. I've been trying to figure out how to use different methods of learning Navigation
         bars and one of my projects is to build a site using a lot of Bootstrap. Just to get a good feel of what I can
         do with Bootstrap. There's a lot of different things with the Navigation bar with Bootstrap or just in general
         honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
         Below is an example of a "basic" nav bar with Bootstrap. I feel like basic is an overstatement however, since
         all it is is the logo or main text of the web page really. As you can see it's not the most pleasing navigation
         bar and it doesn't really have much to go from. I feel like this would be really cool for something like my
         portfolio page on my main website. It can be created inside a nav or div element although nav makes more sense
         due to the recent updates with browsers and HTML 5.
      </p>
   </section>

   <h2 class="display-2">Basic Navbars</h2>
   <nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-dark">
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand Dark</a>
   </nav>
   <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-light">
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand Light</a>
   </nav>
   <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-warning">
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand Warning</a>
   </nav>
   <section class=>
      <p>
         As shown from the examples above, they're basically the same thing however, one is dark and the other is light.
         There is something else that I can add to this apparently to make the text stand out more and it's by using the
         classes "mb-0" and "h1". Also the class "navbar-light" or "navbar-dark" only changes the text, it doesn't
         actually change the background. I've use the class for the backgrounds already which is "bg-dark" or something
         else. If I really wanted to I could do something like "bg-primary" which would give me the primary colour as a
         background. I'll add another example above to show this off using the warning colour. "mb-0" and "h1" are to
         just style this a little differently it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the next example below I'll be adding an image to the brand, it still won't have any links just yet but I'll
         get onto that in the example after. The below example is using container-fluid class and not container.
      </p>
   </section>

   <h3 class="display-3">Basic Navbar Logo</h3>
   <nav class="navbar bg-primary">
      <div class="container-fluid">
         <a href="#" class="navbar-brand">
            <img src="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/assets/brand/bootstrap-logo-shadow.png" alt="Bootstrap"
               width="30" height="24">
         </a>
      </div>
   </nav>

   <section>
      <p>
         With the next example I'm going to combine the Brandname with the logo.

      </div>
   </nav>

   <h2 class="display-2">Navbars With Links</h2>
   <section>
      <p>
         Okay so with the more basic navbars out of the way I'll be moving onto the more "exciting" part of this since I
         love figuring out how stuff like this works, apart from the grid system, flexbox or the bootstrap grid and
         alignment system. Those are hard for my head for some reason. Eitherway lets get onto making a normal navbar,
         without any drop downs for now.
      </p>
      <p>
         So what's interesting already is that there's a few ways to put the links within the navbar and the one method
         I knew of was to add an un-ordered list and then li elements within that list with a elements within those. But
         it looks like there's an easier to read method at least to do this. It's using divs which I don't really like
         to use but it seems a bit nicer to me. Below are some screenshots of what I mean.
      </p>
   </section>

   <div class="row">
      <h3 class="display-3 col-6">Un-ordered List Method</h3>
      <h3 class="display-3 col-6">Div Element Method</h3>
   </div>
   <div class="row">
      <img class="col-6" src="images/un-ordered list.png" alt="Un-ordered list Method">
      <img class="col-6" src="images/div element.png" alt="Div Element Method">
   </div>

   <section>
      <p>
         As you can see from the list method it seems very chaotic, which is why I'm trying out the div method on my
         main website right now. I'm still a little reluctant to use bootstrap on my main website still though. I really
         want to figure out how these work in both ways so I can make and edit my own anytime I want to. Either way I'm
         going to continue onto the next navbar.
      </p>
   </section>

   <h3 class="display-3">First Navbar With Links</h3>
   <section>
      <p>
         So it starts off like any other nav bar, you have the nav class as the main parent class and then an a link for
         the main element which is usually a logo or a brandname. Then the links come in and this is the part that can
         be different like I've showcased above.
      </p>
      <p>
         After writing this all out, I'm a little confused honestly but I feel like I'll figure it out after the end of
         this lesson. Some of the classes or attributes used are a little confusing or haven't been explained yet,
         mainly talking about the aria attributes. But I believe there was one mentioned a while ago saying it had
         something to do with accessability. Yeah something that Colt says is that "Even though it's shorter, there's
         still a lot to do." I couldn't resonate with this more if I tried.
      </p>
      <p>
         Some of the first few classes that are mentioned are "active" and "disabled". And I mean these first two are
         pretty straight forward. Active is to show which link is active in the navbar aka which link the user has
         currently selected. Where as disabled is the opposite basically, it's showing a link that cannot be selected.
         There are a few other classes mentioned which have to do with the a elements within the div. It seems like the
         a links need the classes "nav-link" and "nav-link". This is where I would also put the classes I mentioned
         before "active" and "disabled".
      </p>
      <p>
         Something to note is that if the div with the class of "navbar-nav" was not a child of another div with the
         classes of "collapse" and "navbar-collapse" then the a links would not go across the navbar like how I'd expect
         they would go to the end of the navbar and act as if they were in a column. The collapse class is a plugin a
         part of Bootstrap that allows us to collapse and hide things, used on stuff like accordians etc. It can also be
         used in navbars to show and hide things. So to get the navbar to expand these links, I have to put a class
         inside the nav element called "navbar-expand-(size)". Giving a size to where I want to the navbar to expand.
         For example if I set it to navbar-expand-md then the navbar will expand the collapsed navbar to show the links
         at the medium breakpoint. And below it would stop showing these links. It's good for when there's a burger menu
         implemented for the smaller screens.
      </p>
      <p>
         So for the burger menu that shows up is from the button which is nested within the main nav element. The button
         has the class of "navbar-toggler". I'm not sure this is what makes it tranform however, since I know some
         JavaScript goes into this to make it work, I'm sure I'll get shown this later in how this works. Button has a
         span with the class of "navbar-toggler-icon" inside of it which is basically the icon for the little toggleable
         menu. If I was just to include the button and the span with the classes I've given it then it wouldn't really
         do much since it hasn't been "linked" with the actual navbar that has the links. Meaning if I don't link it
         with the actual navbar it doesn't do anything but does display.
      </p>
      <p>
         The way to connect the button with the navbar/links to extend when clicking on the button is by adding a
         "data-target" attribute with the same value as the id in the div that surrounds the navlinks. The only
         difference is that the data-target attribute has a # infront of the value. So for example id=testNav meaning
         that the data-target=#testNav. There is one other thing too with this however, that being a data-toggle
         attribute which is set collapse. Which is also a class within the same div around the navlinks. data-target is
         the id of something that we want it to expand of collapse. Also just as I thought, without Javascript this
         doesn't work.

   <h3 class="display-3">Navbar With Dropdowns</h3>
   <section>
      <p>
         Ah the dreaded drop down navbar, something I hope to master one day. It's not looked at I don't think within
         the course so I'm going to try figure it out myself. So lets take a look and take the example I have from
         above and see if I can expand upon it below. Something else to note is that I technically can put any content
         within the nav but I wouldn't really other than a form which is normally used for a search box input. So it
         seems like with drop down menus I can't really use the method above. Meaning I will need to use the method with
         more markup.
      </p>
      <p>
         Looks like I'll be figuring out the other method in how to build one of these.
      </p>

            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>

   <section>
      <p>
         Okay so from what I've done above is made a dropdown navbar using the content I would put inside it for my
         website. Just so I don't have to put random ideas inside it basically and see what an actual use case would
         look like. The first thing I noticed about making these is that the "li" element with the class of "nav-link",
         now has another class called "dropdown-toggle" along with a few more attributes being, 'type="button"' and
         'data-bs-toggle="dropdown"'. I'm not sure exactly what these do however, but I believe the data-bs-toggle has
         something to link this element with javascript maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
         As for the 'role="button"' I'm just assuming it makes this a link act like a button rather than a hyperlink.
         But then it gives the question of "Why not just use a button then?" And right now I don't have an answer to
         this sadly. :/ Moving onto the next piece of this, there's another un-ordered list within this "li" element
         with the class of "dropdown-menu", something to do with the styling I'm assuming. Not sure how JavaScript fully
         works right now so it might have something to do with this as well but I'm not 100% sure.
      </p>
      <p>
         Within that ul element there are more li elements with a elements nested inside with the class name of
         "dropdown-item" which is actually the most straight forward thing about this so far. Since the a elements are
         basically the content in which I would want to drop down and be the links that are supposed to be there. And
         that's about it honestly. I would love to know how to do this via HTML and CSS though. The HTML I can see and
         understand. It's the CSS. I know Javascript is in this as well but I will want to learn that later.
