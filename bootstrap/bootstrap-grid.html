      <h1 class="display-1 text-center text-primary">Grid System</h3>
         <p>Moving onto the Grid System for BootStrap, I'm not sure if it's similar or as complicated as Flexbox. For
            some reason it takes a little getting used to for me when it comes to these concepts and practices. The
            main difference for this, well at least I think it is, is that the grid system via using Bootstrap is
            prebuilt to be responsive already.</p>
         <p>There's a few things that need to be mentioned before using the grid system and the first one is that to
            use the grid system, it must be within an element with the container class. The next thing is to create
            an element with the class of row. The most important piece to understand is the content going into the
            element with the class of row. Every row has 12 units of space to div up, for example if there was 4
            elements then each would get 3 units each. Some can take more than others but the total is always 12.</p>
         <p>Columns are what go within here and to do this it's done with the "col" class. Below is an example of a
            really simple way to divide up the space. There are other and more in depth ways to do this though which
            will be shown in example 2.</p>
         <h2 class="display-2 text-center text-info">Example 1</h2>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col text-center bg-warning">Col Autosized</div>
            <div class="col text-center bg-primary">Col Autosized</div>
            <div class="col text-center bg-danger">Col Autosized</div>
         </div>
         <h2 class="display-2 text-center text-info">Example 3</h2>
         <p>Might be wondering why example 3 is here, and it's mainly because I did the autosizing "col" class first but
            either way there's something else to take from this. And it's that I was right the other just autosize based
            on how many units are left over. Although apparently this is the lazy way to do it. It also shows off that I
            can do a mixture of auto-sized and manually set columns.</p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col text-center bg-primary">Autosized</div>
            <div class="col text-center bg-info">Autosized</div>
            <div class="col-9 text-center bg-warning">Manual</div>
            <div class="col text-center bg-danger">Autosized</div>
         </div>
         <h2 class="display-2 text-center text-info">Example 2</h2>
         <p>With the example below I'll be looking at a more in depth way to split up this grid system. So from the
            example below the first column uses a different class which is "col-4" what this means is Column and then 4
            units. So the first column is taking up 4 units from the 12, meaning there's 8 units left over. The second
            column is using "col-6" which it is pretty straight forward now. So the answer would be that it's using 6
            units instead of the 4. And lastly the final column is using the final 2 units, I didn't have to put col-2 I
            don't think. I'm sure bootstrap would understand there's only 2 units left so it would only get those two
            units. But I filled it in anyway. I can also have them total to less than 12, and later on I'll learn how to
            center stuff or allowing the others to use up that extra space etc.
         </p>
         <p>
            I can put any content within these columns that I want like forms, images etc. Something interesting
            mentioned was Cards which we haven't gotten into quite yet. Another thing to mention is that container
            classed elements can be nested inside one another. Having the two examples below shows that the one with a
            div is slightly smaller than the one that isn't nested inside another container. Finally, col-# col = column
            and # = the number of units to give this column.
         </p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col-4 text-center bg-warning">Col-4</div>
            <div class="col-6 text-center bg-primary">Col-6</div>
            <div class="col-2 text-center bg-danger">Col-2</div>
         </div>
         <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
               <div class="col-4 text-center bg-warning">Col-4</div>
