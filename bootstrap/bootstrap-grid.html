      <h1 class="display-1 text-center text-primary">Grid System</h3>
         <p>Moving onto the Grid System for BootStrap, I'm not sure if it's similar or as complicated as Flexbox. For
            some reason it takes a little getting used to for me when it comes to these concepts and practices. The
            main difference for this, well at least I think it is, is that the grid system via using Bootstrap is
            prebuilt to be responsive already.</p>
         <p>There's a few things that need to be mentioned before using the grid system and the first one is that to
            use the grid system, it must be within an element with the container class. The next thing is to create
            an element with the class of row. The most important piece to understand is the content going into the
            element with the class of row. Every row has 12 units of space to div up, for example if there was 4
            elements then each would get 3 units each. Some can take more than others but the total is always 12.</p>
         <p>Columns are what go within here and to do this it's done with the "col" class. Below is an example of a
            really simple way to divide up the space. There are other and more in depth ways to do this though which
            will be shown in example 2.</p>
         <h3 class="display-3 text-center text-info">Example 1</h3>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col text-center bg-warning">Col Autosized</div>
            <div class="col text-center bg-primary">Col Autosized</div>
            <div class="col text-center bg-danger">Col Autosized</div>
         </div>
         <h3 class="display-2 text-center text-info">Example 3</h2>
            <p>Might be wondering why example 3 is here, and it's mainly because I did the autosizing "col" class first
               but
               either way there's something else to take from this. And it's that I was right the other just autosize
               based
               on how many units are left over. Although apparently this is the lazy way to do it. It also shows off
               that I
               can do a mixture of auto-sized and manually set columns.</p>
            <div class="row">
               <div class="col text-center bg-primary">Autosized</div>
               <div class="col text-center bg-info">Autosized</div>
               <div class="col-9 text-center bg-warning">Manual</div>
               <div class="col text-center bg-danger">Autosized</div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="display-3 text-center text-info">Example 2</h3>
            <p>With the example below I'll be looking at a more in depth way to split up this grid system. So from the
               example below the first column uses a different class which is "col-4" what this means is Column and then
               4
               units. So the first column is taking up 4 units from the 12, meaning there's 8 units left over. The
               second
               column is using "col-6" which it is pretty straight forward now. So the answer would be that it's using 6
               units instead of the 4. And lastly the final column is using the final 2 units, I didn't have to put
               col-2 I
               don't think. I'm sure bootstrap would understand there's only 2 units left so it would only get those two
               units. But I filled it in anyway. I can also have them total to less than 12, and later on I'll learn how
               to
               center stuff or allowing the others to use up that extra space etc.
            </p>
            <p>
               I can put any content within these columns that I want like forms, images etc. Something interesting
               mentioned was Cards which we haven't gotten into quite yet. Another thing to mention is that container
               classed elements can be nested inside one another. Having the two examples below shows that the one with
               a
               div is slightly smaller than the one that isn't nested inside another container. Finally, col-# col =
               column
               and # = the number of units to give this column.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
               <div class="col-4 text-center bg-warning">Col-4</div>
               <div class="col-6 text-center bg-primary">Col-6</div>
               <div class="col-2 text-center bg-danger">Col-2</div>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
               <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-4 text-center bg-warning">Col-4</div>
                  <div class="col-6 text-center bg-primary">Col-6</div>
                  <div class="col-2 text-center bg-danger">Col-2</div>
               </div>

      <h2 class="display-2">Responsive Layouts Using Bootstrap</h2>
      <p>
         So now moving onto the more important part of Bootstrap grid. It's basically the responsive part of it all of
         how things rescale depending on the screen size etc. Or as Colt says "Create responsive layouts". This is done
         via the built in breakpoints in bootstrap, I think this means that at X pixels there's a media query basically.
         Eitherway, it seems that using the predefined class names for example col-sm is small which is set around 540px
         to 768, anything below this is classed as being extra small and anything above this is classed as medium. These
         can be referenced at any point with elements when using the grid system. Okay it seems a little more
         complicated than I originally thought since I've already looked into col-8 etc. But apparently there's ones
         such as col-sm-8 which I have no idea what this would mean.
      </p>
      <p>
         So below I have two elements that are 50%/50% which is 6/6 units. But if I wanted to have only one of the
         elements on the page at a time then the way I would do this is by the following; Instead of using col-6 I could
         use col-md-6. What this means is that after medium breakpoint and up take up 6 units and everything below is
         the medium size. To make it easier to see, the div elements have been given a background colour each.
         I could also make it so if I had another two div elements which I will add now, I could have all 4 elements
         take up the same space if on a large breakpoint. Meaning the bigger the screen the more content it can have
         horizontally and the smaller the screen, I can move that horizontal content vertically. Right now all I've done
         is made the elements take up 6 units of space if the screen size is bigger than the medium breakpoint and sit
         by themselves if the screen size is lower than this breakpoint.
