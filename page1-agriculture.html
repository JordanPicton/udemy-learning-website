<!--The head element basically contains things that aren't needed to be shown on the page. (Information about the webpage.)-->

<head>
   <!--The "title" element changes the name/displayed text in the tab view for that site/webpage. Doesn't show up in the page itself but it does for the browsers tab naming.-->

   <!--The "main" element is similar to a div, however instead of being generic it's kind of specific. In the sense of the content that should be within this container,
      should be things that ARE NOT repeated on other pages of the site. For example Navigation Bars, Logos, Sidebars and Footers etc. It comes more handy for readability and accessability.-->
   <main>

            I'm assuming these can be used in and out of the main element due to Colt saying they can be used to navigate the same page, different pages or external sources of the website and the web.
            Not only that but in the videa, using Wikipedia as an example, you can see that there' nav both in and out of where I would personally put the main content.

         development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming
         of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to
         live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago.
         After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago,
         nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep,
         goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants
         were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world.
         Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth
         century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion
         people still depended on subsistence agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
         The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods,
         fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include
         cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs,
         and fungi. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in
         agriculture, second only to the service sector, although in recent
         decades, the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers
         continues, especially in developing countries, where smallholding is
         being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that brings
         an enormous crop yield increase.
      </p>
      <p>
         Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and
         fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop
         yields, but cause ecological and environmental damage. Selective
         breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly
         increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal
         welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include
         contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation,
         antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is
         both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as
         biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and global
         warming, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically
         modified organisms are widely used, although some are banned in certain
         countries.
      </p>

      <!--Similar to the other semantic elements (nav, main, aside) section is used when there's no other specific cotainer that can be used. They're mainly used to break up a section of the website

         these and apparently they're still better to use over div elements. You could technically use a section instead of a nav for navigation. But using nav for navigation makes more sense.
         It's just a nice way to divide up the markup. "Every section of content."-->

            <!--The sub (subscript) element does the opposite of what sup does. Instead of pushing it half a line above the normal text, it pushes it down.

            The word agriculture is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin
            agricultūra, from ager 'field' and cultūra 'cultivation' or
            'growing'.<sub>[2]</sub> While agriculture usually refers to human
            activities, certain species of ant,[3][4] termite and beetle have been
            cultivating crops for up to 60 million years.[5] Agriculture is
            defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural
            resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food,
            fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related
            services".[6] Thus defined, it includes arable farming, horticulture,
            animal husbandry and forestry, but horticulture and forestry are in
            practice often excluded.[6] It may also be broadly decomposed into
            plant agriculture, which concerns the cultivation of useful plants,[7]
            and animal agriculture, the production of agricultural animals.[8]

            <!--Here is an example of superscript and subscript working together.-->
            <br />
            <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> = 1

      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>
         The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many
         times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering.[11]
         Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,[12] and
         included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centers of
         origin.[9] Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000
         years ago.[13] In the Paleolithic Levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals
         cultivation of emmer, barley, and oats has been observed near the sea of
         Galilee.[14][15] Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200
         BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,[16] followed by
         mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia
         between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.[17] Cattle were domesticated from
         the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500
         years ago.[18] Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East
         Asia and Southwest Asia,[19] where wild boar were first domesticated
         about 10,500 years ago.[20] In the Andes of South America, the potato
         was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans,
         coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some root
         vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago.
         Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years
         ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,[21] and was
         independently domesticated in Eurasia. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was
         bred into maize by 6,000 years ago.[22] The horse was domesticated in
         the Eurasian Steppes around 3500 BC.[23] Scholars have offered multiple
         hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of
         the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate
         an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples
         are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic
         in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started
         to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.[24][25][26]
      </p>

      <!--Similar to the nav element and section element the article is the element where we should put things that we want to reuse on the site but it is it's own container. For example if a
         website wanted to display the weather it could have a little area for this. There are some specific usage rules for this though which can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article#usage_notes
         Article elements may nest inside other article elements too. It just depends on the use case each person or company has for these.-->
      <article></article>

      <!--aside elements are another container type that has a specific use case in the sense of these are mainly used for things like side bars or call out boxes. 
         They're not really the main thing for the page but they're there for users to have ease of access to various pieces of content.
         Again it's similar to the other samentic containers and is better than just using a generic div or span container.-->
      <aside></aside>

      <!--Divs are Content Division elements, it's a generic container to group content together. When using a div element it is worth mentioning it's a block element.
         Meaning that it will force other elements above or below it since it will take the entire space. This DOES NOT mean the items inside the div element (the inline elements) become block elements.
         Using a div element by itself in HTML isn't really worth it due to it not really doing much by itself. The better features come in when we learn CSS. When styling with CSS (meaning the div and not a specific
         element within the div) the entire div will be styled. This doesn't mean you can't style specific elements within the div itself to look different however.
         For an example of this being a block element I'll add a third link underneath the div to show this off.
         "Takes up it's own block of content."-->
      <div>

      <a href="https://youtu.be/KnpLpWolUW8">Link to one of my favoruite songs.</a>
      <!--This link should not be on the same line as the other two inside the div element. (Which it's not. :))-->

      <h2>Civilizations</h2>

      <!--span elements are similar to divs, the difference being they're used for inline elements, meaing they don't force other content above or below them.
         They're useful for wanting to single something out to style with CSS or do something with. For example:
         "In Eurasia, the <span>Sumerians</span> started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC"
         There are different attributes that are allowed within the span element that can be used by CSS, for instance having a bunch of words or important words be coloured a differened colour from the normal text.
         "Does not take up it's own block of content."
         There are newer and more understandable version of span and divs. Instead of being generic they're a little more explainable. For instance if you have a navigation bar at the top of a webpage and you put it inside a div. Then you're not
         really 100% sure that it is the navigation bar compared to the other divs on the page. In this case the newer one would be the nav element. I am still learning what these are, can do and mean though but apparently they're good for accessability
         as well as making it easier to know what element does what. So they make the code more readable for yourself and or other developers but also giving the benefit of accessability.-->
      <p>
         In Eurasia, the <span>Sumerians</span> started to live in villages from
         about 8,000 BC, relying on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and a canal
         system for irrigation. Ploughs appear in pictographs around 3,000 BC;
         seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables
         such as lentils and onions, and fruits including dates, grapes, and
         figs.[29] Ancient Egyptian agriculture relied on the Nile River and its
         seasonal flooding. Farming started in the predynastic period at the end
         of the Paleolithic, after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such
         as wheat and barley, alongside industrial crops such as flax and
         papyrus.[30][31] In India, wheat, barley and jujube were domesticated by
         9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats.[32] Cattle, sheep and goats
         were domesticated in Mehrgarh culture by 8,000–6,000 BC.[33][34][35]
         Cotton was cultivated by the 5th–4th millennium BC.[36] Archeological
         evidence indicates an animal-drawn plough from 2,500 BC in the Indus
         Valley civilisation.[37]

      <!--The above poem will look identical to how it looks in here due to the line breaks. You can complete the same thing by having it all on the same line with the line breaks (in the code). So something like this:
         "I hold the tool. I am the blade. I drive<br> myself into the fertile ground. I dig<br> potatoes out. They were buried alive,<br> but in darkness they thrive. Now the old pig<br> will feast. When he grows fat I will slay him<br> to feed me and kin. I don't like killing<br> but when necessary it's not a sin.<br> I shall live another year, God willing.<br> I have long been on the land. I am old<br> but my sun is not yet setting in the<br> sky. When I was a child I was told once by<br> my father you become earth when you die.<br> If so, I hope my children carve my chest<br> with blade. I hope I'll yield a fruitful harvest."
         In the quotes above, it would complete the same effect as the active code. However, it's not that readable and if it didn't have the br elements and was written like the active code it would look like the line above. All of the poem on one line.
         The content is still grouped together it just has a line break at the end or wherever it's put into the content of an element.-->

      <!--Below is an example of an HTML entity, these are used mainly when we want to display something like a greater than or less than symbol.
         The one below is the entity code for the club symbol for a deck of playing cards. They always start with a ampersand and end with a semicolon.
         Display reserved characters. Along with difficult to type characters. For example the copyright symbol. The browers reads these and understand which code belongs to which character.
         If I was to change the below live element and text to look something like: "<h2>< Welcome to Coding ></h2>", then the browser wouldn't really enjoy this because it would be reading the
         "<" and ">" symbol thinking there's an element between it and it gets confused because the text between is not an actual HTML element. The browser could actually still display this and everything else fine.
         But there are some characters that are reserved for HTML use and shouldn't be included in text unless they're actually being used for elements and tags. Use entity codes. :)
         Also entity codes are numbered and name based (&lt; = < but so does &#60; = <), just found out that VSC will also help me when trying to unput these codes. :) Along with ampersand (&) this also needs it's own entity code.-->
      <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
      <p>&#9824;, &lt;, &gt;</p>

         <!--The time element is another semantic element but this one is an inline container and represents, time, date time or date.
            It's mainly used to be called out in a machine reable format, so I'm assuming accessability.-->
         My birthday is on the <time datetime="1999-03-26">March 26</time>.

      <!--This is a self contained piece of content that has an optional caption, which is used via the figcaption element inside the figure element. These are usually an illustration, diagram and want to call attention to along with the
         majority of the time having a caption along side this.-->

      <!-- Similar to header, the footer element is another specific container where people can usually find things like links (about, policies, privacy, contact and socials), copyright info and anything else that is generally not needed but is a nice
      touch or required at least somewhere on the page. It's the last of the last things people will look for on a site. And they're usually in the footer for ease of access. Footer is similar to header in the regard that it does not have to be placed
      within the main element but does have to be placed within the body opening and closing tags. -->
      <footer>
         <p>Hello I am a footer. :)</p>

            <li><a href="page2-about.html">About</a></li>

   <!-- There are a bunch more semantic elements that can be used and I've not touched on yet, for example these two were listed in the video but didn't go into too much detail: abbr and data. These are all mainly used
      to make it easier to navigate the code of a site along with making the code easier to read but also make it easier for people who need the accessability options for sites. Apparently these are also really useful for SEO's.-->
