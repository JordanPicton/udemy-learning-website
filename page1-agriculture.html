<!--Short Answer = Think of this as a flag to the browser saying this is using HTML5.
Longer Answer = Tells browsers it's using HTML 5 standard. It doesn't do much most of the time, it just flags to browsers that this website is using the HTML 5 standard.
You can change it to be a lower version, but this won't disable anything via the browser side. It just tells it what to expect.-->

      For example if I want to use a "h3" element then I would need both a "h2" and a "h1" element.
      This is just how the rules work for HTML.
      Also putting any other text on the same line as a "h1" element will force it out of the same space and move it to it's own line.-->

      <!--The "img" element is one element that doesn't have a closing tag. And it's the second element I'll be working with that has an attribute.
      Most attributes follow the same if not then similar pattern. With the example below the image is hosted locally, within the same machine as the website.

      <!--The "alt" attribute is a topic we haven't talked about yet, which is accessability and we will get into that later.
      However for now, this attribute is not required but makes websites more accessible and easier for people for example who use screen readers. The website knows there's some
      information for this image being held within the alt attribute so if someone with a screen reader comes along they would be able to hear what it is that's on the page rather than it being blank.
      Just to note there are some rules on when to use the alt attribute and when to not, this will be talked about when covering accessability.-->

      "href" stands for hypertext reference and it will be inside every anchor element.
      The below example will not work due to the browser reading this as if the user wants to connect to "Users/jordan/Coding/google.com" (Hosted on this machine.) instead of actually google.
      Example 1: <a href="google.com">This is a link.</a>
      In the live example below, you can see that it's got "www." (Hosted on the World Wide Web) at the beginning of the address, this says that this is to be found on the World Wide Web and not this/any other machine this website is hosted on.
      Not only that but we also need the http or https protocols in front of the url to allow us there, at this moment in time we haven't learnt to why yet.-->
      <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google.</a> <!--Live Example showing how to link another website/part of the WWW-->

      <!--"p" elements along with header elements are called block elements, meaning they will push/shove anything else on the same line/space as itself. To be on it's own "block", think of it has a block of houses, you can put people inside them
      but you can't put a house inside another house.
      For example if I was to put an anchor element/hyperlink before the paragraph below it would not be on the same line/space it would be put above the paragraph and then the paragraph would move to
      it's own area. This isn't the same for anchor elements or even image elements, these are called inline elements, meaning they can share the same space as each other.
      This behaviour can be changed with CSS.
      
      Examples of this:
         <a href="This be a link.">Link1</a>
         <a href="This is another link.">Link2</a>
      These two links in the example above would be displayed on the same line shown below:
         This be a link. This is another link.
      
      However, if I was to do something like:
         <h1>I am a title</h1>
         <a href="link to somewhere">Hello I am a link.</a>
      These two elements would be different due to the h1 wanting to take a block all by itself. Meaning it would look like:
         I am a title
         Hello I am a link.-->

         <b>Agriculture</b> or <b>farming</b> is the practice of cultivating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant">plants</a> and livestock.[1] Agriculture was the key
         development in
         the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled
         people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains
         beginning
         at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs and
         cattle
         were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world.
         Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural
         output,
         though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
         The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber).
         Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Over one-third
         of
         the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although in recent decades, the
         global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues, especially in developing countries, where
         smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that brings an enormous crop yield
         increase.
      </p>
      <p>
         Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments
         have
         sharply increased crop yields, but cause ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices
         in
         animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and
         environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers,
         deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive
         to
         environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and global warming, all of
         which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some are banned in
         certain countries.

      <h2>
         Etymology and scope
      </h2>
      <p>
         The word agriculture is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager 'field' and cultūra
         'cultivation' or 'growing'.[2] While agriculture usually refers to human activities, certain species of ant,[3][4]
         termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years.[5] Agriculture is defined with varying
         scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food,
         fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services".[6] Thus defined, it includes arable
         farming,
         horticulture, animal husbandry and forestry, but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.[6] It may
         also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture, which concerns the cultivation of useful plants,[7] and animal
         agriculture, the production of agricultural animals.[8]

      <h2>
         History
      </h2>
      <h3>
         Origins
      </h3>
      <p>
         The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by
         hunting
         and gathering.[11] Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,[12] and included a diverse range
         of
         taxa, in at least 11 separate centers of origin.[9] Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years
         ago.[13] In the Paleolithic Levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals cultivation of emmer, barley, and oats has been
         observed
         near the sea of Galilee.[14][15] Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known
         cultivation from 5,700 BC,[16] followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between
         13,000 and 11,000 years ago.[17] Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and
         Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.[18] Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest
         Asia,[19] where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.[20] In the Andes of South America, the
         potato
         was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.
         Sugarcane
         and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the
         Sahel
         region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,[21] and was independently
         domesticated in Eurasia. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6,000 years ago.[22] The horse was
         domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes around 3500 BC.[23] Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the
         historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate
         an
         initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the
         Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and
         gradually came to be domesticated.[24][25][26]
