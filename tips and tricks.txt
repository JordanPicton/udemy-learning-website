A cool trick with VSC is when creating html documents/pages, instead of writing out all the needed elements every time.
There's a shortcut I can use which is literally, on a fresh page/document press "!" and then press "tab". Below is what it generates for me.

Generated HTML file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
   
</body>
</html>


Another cool trick with VSC is that you can easily comment a section out using CTRL + /
This can also uncomment a section.
