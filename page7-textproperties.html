         <h3>About</h3>
         <p>
            Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories.
         </p>
         <p>
            You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production, and
            fighting
            enemies. Use your imagination to design your factory, combine simple elements into ingenious structures,
            apply
            management skills to keep it working, and protect it from the creatures who don't really like you.
         </p>
         <p>
            The game is very stable and optimized for building massive factories. You can create your own maps, write
            mods in Lua,
            or play with friends via Multiplayer.
         </p>
         <p>

            have bought
            the game. You can get it from Steam, GOG, or directly from our shop.
