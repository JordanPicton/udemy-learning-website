      <section id="one">
         How long can you survive a post-apocalyptic world? A land overrun with an infected "zombie" population,
         where you compete with other survivors for limited resources.
         Will you team up with strangers and stay strong together?
         Or play as a lone wolf to avoid betrayal? This is DayZ â€“ this is your story.

         My parents warned me that the outside world was dangerous, and that, if something were to happen to me, I
         wouldn't know
         what to do. According to my parents, kidnappers, murderers, and kidnapper-murderers lurked on every corner
         of our small,
         suburban town where, statistically, my chances of becoming the victim of a violent crime were less than my
         chances of
         being allowed to cross the street by myself, or, more importantly, being allowed to sleep over at Taylor's
         house.
