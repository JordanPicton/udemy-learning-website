      <h1>My Favourite Games Table</h1>
   </header>
   <!--The "table" element represents tabular data, a two-dimensional table with columns and rows with cells that contain data.-->
   <table>
      <!--The "td" (Table data Cell) element represents a single cell of data. Doing the table like this and only using the "td" elements, all the data would be on the same row.
         <td>Factorio</td> 
         <td>888.3</td>
         <td>20/30</td>
         <td>DayZ</td> 
         <td>662.8</td>
         <td>2/13</td>

         I switched the above table out so that I don't end up with a page with a bunch of tables. And to leave it in here for the explanation above.-->

      <!--The "tr" element is a table row which allows me to place my "td" elements inside and split my data up a little more to make it more readable.
         The below table now has two rows with 3 cells of content each. And they're nicely spaced out between each other along with being formatted nicely.
         (No horrible space difference if one has more characters than the other)
         The only problem with the table below is if a row of data doesn't have the same amount of td (cell) elements then it will go out of line and look weird with the other
         rows. You can fix this by doing a simple thing which is adding an empty cell to the other rows that need them to make everything align again. (As shown below):
         <tr>
            <td>Factorio</td>
            <td>25/01/2023</td>
            <td>888.3</td>
            <td>20/30</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>DayZ</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>662.8</td>
            <td>2/13</td>
         </tr>-->

      <!--The "thead" element and a few other elements, being "tbody" and "tfoot", are used mainly to split up the table, I'm assuming to make it more reable again and for accessability purposes.-->
      <thead>
         <tr>
            <!--The "th" element is the table header which by default has bold text when using just HTML. This can be changed along with many other aspects with CSS.-->
            <th>Game:</th>
            <th>Last Played:</th>
            <th>Hours Played:</th>
            <th>Achievements:</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>
      <!--Again the "tbody" element is mainly used for accessability purposes and for readability from people reading the code. They're really handy for bigger and more complex tables, since the bigger and more
         complex ones are not very accessible in the first place.-->
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>Factorio</td>
            <td>25/01/2023</td>

      <!--"tfoot" elements are rarely used, they're mainly used for things that don't really have anything to do with the main body of data in the table and are generally used for things like averages or totals at the ends
         of the tables.-->
