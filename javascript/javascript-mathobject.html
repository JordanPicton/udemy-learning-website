            Math Object is built into JavaScript which contains properties and methods for mathematical constants and
            functions. It adds a bunch of cool methods for example rounding, absolute values, power to etc. It's an
            object and well I haven't really gone through objects yet other than knowing it's a collection of properties
            and methods.
         </p>
         <p>
            [Math.floor(23.90);] (Output 23) What this method does is it literally just removes the decimal point and
            the numbers after it. Like it just drops it completely. There's another method called ceil which acts a bit
            differently than I would think honestly. For example if I was to do [Math.ceil(67.2);] then it would round
            up. Meaning the output for this would be 68 even if it's got .2 which is not .5 or above. Which is the part
            I find weird. Ah it's because it ALWAYS rounds up and returns the smallest integer that is greater than or
            equal to a given number.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, the main reason to looking into this is because of the built in method called "random" and well
            it's pretty straight forward. It generates a random number however, the difference being that instead of
            giving a full number it gives a number between 0 and 1 (non-inclusive).
         </p>
         <p>
            To get it to use actual integers instead of decimals takes a little more work than just calling the random
            method. There's not any other method that we can use for this like intRandom or something similar there's
            just random but there's a way to get it to work the way I would want it to.
         </p>
         <p>
            It's a multi-step process but it can be done. For example if I wanted to get something like a random number
            between 1 and 10 then there would be 4 steps for this. The first step would be something like [const step1
            = Math.random();] (Output 0.7148541177023955), [const step2 = step1 * 10;] (Output 7.148541177023955),
            [const step3 = Math.floor(step2);] (Output 7), [cons step4 = step3 + 1;] (Output 8).
         </p>
         <p>
            The reasoning behind step 4 in the example above is due to the example looking for a number between 1 and
            10. If it was looking for a number between 0 and 9 then this step wouldn't be needed.
