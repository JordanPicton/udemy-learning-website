            <p>
                Starting with the first of the 5 (7) main primitive types of data, numbers are used a lot in most
                programming languages. This is called Number not numbers, something else to note is that within
                Javascript Numbe covers more than just the one type of Number. So for example within Java there's things
                like Int, Short, Long, Byte, Double, and Flaat types for just numbers, but for Javascript it doesn't
                have this. So with Javascript this type includes, positive, negative, decimal and whole numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a point when typing in numbers that I will lose precision, for example when typing in
                "1.999999999999999" I will get "1.999999999999999" in return. Though when writing "1.9999999999999999"
                basically the same number as before but with an extra 9 (decimal) then it just collapses and counts it
                as a "2". Numbers are permitted a certain amount of space within memory, they're not permitted to just
                fill up the memory cap.

            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <p>
                Javascript comes built in with some basic operations, similar to other languages, I can use things like
                addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo (which shows the remainder from a division
                basically). Just a little heads up on how Javascript does it's calculations with ordering, it goes like
                this, PEMDAS apparently. Which means parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and
                finally subtraction.
            </p>
            <p>
                So there's something called the exponentiation operator within Javascript, and I don't remember seeing
                this being used anywhere prior. But basically this is how it looks firstly, "4 ** 6" which means 4 to
                the power of 6 which would give the result of 4096. (Totally didn't use the console to figure that out.)
            </p>

            <h2>NaN - Not a Number</h2>
            <p>
                So NaN is technically classed as a number within Javascript, it's something like a concept but it
                represents something that is not a number hence the name. Some examples are shown below:
            <ul>
                <li>0/0 - This is a NaN.</li>
                <li>1 + NaN - This is also a NaN.</li>
            </ul>
            With the first example "0/0" this is impossible to do with normal numbers so the same applies to Javascript,
            there's something that this contributes to which is something I haven't touched on yet that is called
            "typeof", I have no idea how this works though. Apparently it's considered similar to an operator, like the
            plus sign for addition.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the difference with the "typeof" operator is that instead of needing 2 inputs like the others,
                this one only needs the one to work. When I type something like "typeof 4" into the console the console
                will print out "number" showing me that this is classed as a number, the same goes for "32.23221" this
                is also classed as a number. And guess what? typing in "NaN" also gives the output of number.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing about NaN is useful for when trying to figure out what is going wrong with some code when an
                operation isn't giving the desired output and gives a NaN. It just means something went wrong somewhere.
                It's also useful to know that when using NaN in operations like the second example then it will also
                return NaN. Kind of like how X number divided by 0 always ends up at 0.

            <h2>Numbers - Quiz</h2>
            <p>
                Moving onto a little quiz, I just need to figure out what this "4+3*4/2" equation means. This is to be
                done without the use of console. So using PEMDAS, 3*4 would be first giving us 12, making the equation
                look like "4+12/2". Now onto the next step, "12/2" which gives me 6, and then I just need to add 4 to
                the 6 which gives me 10.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next question is this "(13%5)**2" 13%5 would be 3 since 5 goes into 13 twice and then 3 is left
                over. Moving onto 3**2, this would give me 9 since 3*3 is 9.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally the last equation "200 + 0/0". Well 0/0 would output a NaN so 200+NaN would give me the final
                output of NaN.
