            <p>
                Starting with the first of the 5 (7) main primitive types of data, numbers are used a lot in most
                programming languages. This is called Number not numbers, something else to note is that within
                Javascript Numbe covers more than just the one type of Number. So for example within Java there's things
                like Int, Short, Long, Byte, Double, and Flaat types for just numbers, but for Javascript it doesn't
                have this. So with Javascript this type includes, positive, negative, decimal and whole numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a point when typing in numbers that I will lose precision, for example when typing in
                "1.999999999999999" I will get "1.999999999999999" in return. Though when writing "1.9999999999999999"
                basically the same number as before but with an extra 9 (decimal) then it just collapses and counts it
                as a "2". Numbers are permitted a certain amount of space within memory, they're not permitted to just
                fill up the memory cap.
            </p>
            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <p>
                Javascript comes built in with some basic operations, similar to other languages, I can use things like
                addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo (which shows the remainder from a division
                basically). Just a little heads up on how Javascript does it's calculations with ordering, it goes like
                this, PEMDAS apparently. Which means parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and
                finally subtraction.
            </p>
            <p>
                So there's something called the exponentiation operator within Javascript, and I don't remember seeing
                this being used anywhere prior. But basically this is how it looks firstly, "4 ** 6" which means 4 to
                the power of 6 which would give the result of 4096. (Totally didn't use the console to figure that out.)
