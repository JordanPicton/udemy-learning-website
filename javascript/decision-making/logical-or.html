                Welcome to the next logical operator which is the OR operator. I've kind of used this already within the
                AND javascript file, along with explaining it in there. But this document will be all about the OR
                operator (hopefully).
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like the Logical AND operator the OR is used within the condition to join two different expressions
                to make a larger expression. The symbols used to represent the OR are "||" which are also called pipe
                characters. These aren't the number 1 or the character "L"s.
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference between the AND opertator and the OR operator is that the OR operator only needs one of
                the conditions to be true, thing1 OR thing2, if one of these is true then the whole expression would be
                true. Whereas the AND operator needs thing1 AND thing2 to be true before the whole expression would be
                true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The operator only cares if ONE of the two is true, they both don't have to be true ONLY ONE! For example
                I can play video games IF I have cleaned my room OR studied. Rather than needing the two to be true I
                only need the one to be true for the expression to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The little example I've linked with this page is basically checking the input from the user to the
                values it has stored already. They either have to match with "'Charlie" OR "Jordan", if it matches with
                one of these then it's good and the whole expression is classed as true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typing in the values "Jordan" OR "Charlie" will result in the expression being true, though writing
                anything else is false.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the example I've used before which is the ticket pricing example I'll be redoing this with the OR
                operator.
