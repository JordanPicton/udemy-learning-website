                Welcome to the next logical operator which is the OR operator. I've kind of used this already within the
                AND javascript file, along with explaining it in there. But this document will be all about the OR
                operator (hopefully).
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like the Logical AND operator the OR is used within the condition to join two different expressions
                to make a larger expression. The symbols used to represent the OR are "||" which are also called pipe
                characters. These aren't the number 1 or the character "L"s.
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference between the AND opertator and the OR operator is that the OR operator only needs one of
                the conditions to be true, thing1 OR thing2, if one of these is true then the whole expression would be
                true. Whereas the AND operator needs thing1 AND thing2 to be true before the whole expression would be
                true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The operator only cares if ONE of the two is true, they both don't have to be true ONLY ONE! For example
                I can play video games IF I have cleaned my room OR studied. Rather than needing the two to be true I
                only need the one to be true for the expression to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The little example I've linked with this page is basically checking the input from the user to the
                values it has stored already. They either have to match with "'Charlie" OR "Jordan", if it matches with
                one of these then it's good and the whole expression is classed as true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typing in the values "Jordan" OR "Charlie" will result in the expression being true, though writing
                anything else is false.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the example I've used before which is the ticket pricing example I'll be redoing this with the OR
                operator. So instead of having two clauses for two conditions, it can be easier to just put these two
                conditions within the same expression making it a larger condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically just taking two similar conditions that make sense and putting them together if only one of
                them is needed to be correct then use them with the OR operator. Now adding an AND operator to make sure
                the user is inputting an age between 0 and 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this new example, using that expression within the same condition allows there to be less code for
                the same thing. Not only that but when adding an AND to the same condition also allows me to choose
                between two values giving a range. So the age >= 0 AND age &lt;=3 would be one expression and then the
                OR >=65 would be another expression within the conditional.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this would not stop people being allowed to input -10 due to it initially being false when
                using the condition above. But when moving onto the next condition, since it doesn't have a range of
                values and only checks one condition expression. It means that the -10 will work for this condition
                being IF age &lt;= 12, this would be true since it's not checking if the number is above 0 within this
                expression it's ONLY checking if the number is below 12 and this would be classed as true. To fix this
                though, all I would need to do is add an expression with an AND operator. (Which I'm doing right after
                this sentence by the way!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Combining AND and OR operators gives me ranges that I can work with in the conditionals. Using the AND
                is what allows the ranges really. Using the OR just allows me to check for something else if the first
                thing doesn't work but if all things work then just forget about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to note is that Colt talks about precedence here and that how the && operator will be ran
                before the OR. Something to do to make it clear which one I would like to run first to by using
                paranthesis and surrounding the expression that I want to be ran first (which I have already done with
                the first example).
