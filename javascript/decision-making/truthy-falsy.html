                This seems like an interesting part of JavaScript. Seems a little commical but at the same time
                interesting. First off these aren't really official terms for the way to describe this, but it's to do
                with how some values within JavaScript will be read as true and others as false.
            </p>
            <p>
                A really good example of this would be the value "null" or "" (an empty String). These two would
                technically be counted as falsy by JavaScript. However, ALL JavaScript values inherit truthyness or
                falsyness. A list of falsyness values are show below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>false</li>
                <li>0</li>
                <li>"" (empty String)</li>
                <li>null</li>
                <li>undefined</li>
                <li>NaN</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Reading that list must mean everything else is truthy, because they have an actual value? Well this is
                my own understanding for now so let's see what I've missed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's only one set of real true and false, but this concept does matter and will be noticeable when
                learning more. Every single value within JavaScript is considered truthy except from the ones listed
                above. Okay this relates to what I saw on the last chapter which was about the nested conditionals,
                where I saw that if the user hit escape on the prompt box then it would say it's null.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which in turn technically means if this value is needed in a condition then it's classed as false
                already because null is falsy. Which means that this code would be skipped over as if it was given an
                actual value and then came back as false.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've added a script on here to see it in practice essentially. So firtly I'm creating a constant
                variable in which the it's looking for user input. If the user enters no input by hitting enter right
                away or hitting escape or cancel then the value of userInput would be "" (empty String). Which means
                that this input would be inheritly falsy from JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                The condition for this example is literally just (userInput) which JavaScript will read and use this
                Truthy and Falsy concept to figure out if what the user has entered is True or False. If the user has
                actually given some input then it would be Truthy and the there will be a console message saying this.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if they give nothing or somehow get one of the other values from the list above then it will be
                classed as Falsy and will print out Fasly in the console. Writing the condition with just the variable
                will check for this, no needing to use an operator for this built in inheritance check from JavaScript.
            </p>
        </section>

            <p>
                Another example would be very similar to the example above, but this time instead of checking userInput
                and for an empty String. If I was to use the number 0 inside the conditional instead of the String then,
                JavaScript would do a similar check but in this case it would always be Falsy in the console due to the
                conditional not pulling the value and having it set there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same will happen with the other values from the list, if they're passed into the conditional and put
                in the same place as the 0 was in the last example then they'd get the same output. Something to note is
                that any other number than 0 being sat in that condition would be Truthy, even negative numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This seems to just be because JavaScript would want an actual value there to test before hand, but when
                given the list of values above then there's no point in checking them because they're already false as
                they're empty technically. However, given any other value then it will have make sure if the value given
                is true or false in regards to the condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even having a space " ", like this would be considered truthy. It's something that I'd be able to take
                advantage of later on, when doing something like the first exampe "userInput", being actual user input a
                variable or some data coming from somewhere else. It's an easy way to check if the value has been
                defined really. For example if I wanted to make sure someones password was actually set then I'd use the
                same example as userInput for the password that's already stored and if it comes back as false then I
                know that there's an anomaly there because in all cases you can't have an account without a password so
                there SHOULD be a password.
            </p>
            <p>
                Used to check if a variable has data, or if something holds an actual value. I wouldn't need to put
                something like "if userInput ===" or "if userInput !==" blah blah blah. Simply using the variable name
                or value itself within the condition can give me that answer. Knowing this will be useful for the next
                set of lessons around Logical Operators.
