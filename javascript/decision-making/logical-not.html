                Now moving onto the Logical Not Operator! This is the last of the logical operators, this doesn't really
                combine two expressions but it can be used to flip the outcome of an expression. For example if a
                condition was going to give the output of false then using the NOT operator this would flip the output
                to then give the value of true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to do this would be like so, lets say I have something like [let dogs = 3;] and then I want to
                check this within an IF statemnent like so [if (dogs === 3)] this would be true because dogs is equal to
                3. However, if I wanted to flip this output then I would do this [if !(dogs === 3)]. There needs to be
                the "!" exclamation mark before the expression that is flipped. Could also look like [!null] which would
                give the output of true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another easier example to understand this maybe would be to do this !false = true and !true = false. It
                flips the expressions outcome basically. Another example of this would be 1 === 1 would be true however,
                !(1 === 1) would be false.
            </p>

                Interesting, so this can be used more than once in a weird way and a way that wouldn't be used. But if
                you really wanted to then something like this could be done !!true = true and !!!false = true. I just
                keeps flipping with the amount of NOT operators there are. I can see why it wouldn't be used, it's
                pretty funky.
            </p>

                !expression returns true if the expression is false and vice versa. These logical operators are
                foundational, and are used a lot.
