            <h2>Browser Console</h2>
            <p>
                I just wanted to quickly add a piece about the use of the browser console where I've been testing some
                of the code so far with JavaScript. I wanted to mention that when using this, it's good to use when it's
                just for testing since when the page gets reloaded the code typed in will be forgotten.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Internal</h2>
            <p>
                So this is similar to how CSS has internal code on a HTML page, the CSS code is located within the style
                element which is nested within the head element and not the header element. Usually located towards the
                top of the document, I don't see any reason this element would be anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the JavaScript code is located in the script element which from what I know is located at the
                bottom of the document before the closing body tag, though I just looked it up and it seems it can also
                be located within the head tag just like the link/style tag. But from what I can see it's mostly best to
                put it towards the bottom just before the closing body tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reasoning to why the script element is being placed towards the bottom of the document is due to
                when JavaScript is interacting with some HTML elements. For example having a button and then when
                clicked it will run some JavaScript in the background. Well those elements need to be defined first
                before the JavaScript code is implemented basically because code reads top down.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>External</h2>
            <p>
                There's also a way to run JavaScript externally, just like CSS again. However I believe there's a little
                more too it but I can't fully remember honestly since I'm both learning JavaScript in College and by
                myself currently, the main difference being the self learning goes into more detail really and is more
                up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay so the difference for linking a JavaScript file is that, instead of using the link element like CSS
                external files, I'll be using the script element with a src (source) attribute directing the script to a
                .js file that will hold all the code for JavaScript. Also the script element is not a self closing
                element like the link element is.
            </p>
            <p>
                So from now on the JavaScript code is going to be within a .js file and I'll have notes within them to
                help me understand how certain things work. HTML files and CSS files are basically the Foundation and
                then Styling of the page respectively, then JavaScript is more of the doing/responsive kind of things on
                the website. Being different from the repsonsive styling that can come from CSS, responsive with
                JavaScript is more like interaction based, for example when someone clicks a like button and you can see
                how many likes a post has etc.
            </p>
            <h3>First JavaScript Code</h3>
            <p>
                The first little bit of code I've done with JavaScript is located in the internal-external.js file and
                the very top piece just prints out a String in console saying "Hello, this is the first JavaScript file
                I've made!" along with having a comment above this in the js file, that's all I've done up to now. And
                I'll be adding more with learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I'm working within the file, I'll be using it to see the results of the code that I'm using
                within the file. However if I want to actual see anything from the code, like outputs etc. I would have
                to do what you would do with other languages and get them to manually show in the console otherwise
                nothing would show there.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example doing 1 + 3; inside the js file will run but it won't show in the console by itself because
                the browser knows to just run the code within that file however, you have to manually specify it to show
                the values and outputs with the console.log command to see what is happening. The best way to see the
                example work would be to make a variable and then printout the variabale to the console and see what
                it's doing or has done to that variable.
