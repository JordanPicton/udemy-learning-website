        <h1>Internal And External JavaScript</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Internal</h2>
            <p>
                So this is similar to how CSS has internal code on a HTML page, the CSS code is located within the style
                element which is nested within the head element and not the header element. Usually located towards the
                top of the document, I don't see any reason this element would be anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the JavaScript code is located in the script element which from what I know is located at the
                bottom of the document before the closing body tag, though I just looked it up and it seems it can also
                be located within the head tag just like the style tag.

    </main>
