            <h2>Browser Console</h2>
            <p>
                I just wanted to quickly add a piece about the use of the browser console where I've been testing some
                of the code so far with JavaScript. I wanted to mention that when using this, it's good to use when it's
                just for testing since when the page gets reloaded the code typed in will be forgotten.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Internal</h2>
            <p>
                So this is similar to how CSS has internal code on a HTML page, the CSS code is located within the style
                element which is nested within the head element and not the header element. Usually located towards the
                top of the document, I don't see any reason this element would be anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the JavaScript code is located in the script element which from what I know is located at the
                bottom of the document before the closing body tag, though I just looked it up and it seems it can also
                be located within the head tag just like the style tag.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>External</h2>
            <p>
                There's also a way to run JavaScript externally, just like CSS again. However I believe there's a little
                more too it but I can't fully remember honestly since I'm both learning JavaScript in College and by
                myself currently, the main difference being the self learning goes into more detail really and is more
                up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay so the difference for linking a JavaScript file is that, instead of using the link element like CSS
                external files, I'll be using the script element with a src (source) attribute directing the script to a
                .js file that will hold all the code for JavaScript.
