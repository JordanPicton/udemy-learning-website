                So now the Switch statement, this seems slightly intimidating and I'm not fully sure if that's because
                it's currently 00:53 or because this just seems like a slightly more in depth topic. It looks hard to
                understand but simple at the same time it's quite confusing.

                The Switch statement seems pretty interesting however, Colt says that it isn't commonly used. Though
                looking it up, from what I can see is that people are saying it's a good alternative than having
                multiple if statements.

                is a good source that will be helpful. I'll probably look into these a little more myself when I find
                some good use cases for them. I've had a little more time to have a look at them and honestly they don't
                seem that bad, it's just an alternative way to using IF statements, they're wrote differently but they
                seem to give the same outcome.

                The one thing that does confuse me though is that I'm not sure how to use the combinator operators with
                this. Other than that it seems fine to me. Apparently in the real world this statement isn't as common
                as things like "Typical", "Conditional", IF and IF ELSE. (Not sure if Typical or Conditional are
                different from the IF or IF ELSE statements but I'll leave them here for now.)

                Getting into how the Switch statement works, requires a few different pieces of syntax, just like an IF
                statement has it's own syntax. There's the keyword which is "switch", the next being "case". But then
                there's a few other words which are "break", and "default" but I'm not sure if these are classed as
                keywords just yet.
            </p>

                I've also linked up another script to this document to help with understanding this concept. I made an
                example within the file of switch-statement.js and I created the example with IF statements first.
                Though in this case it would be better to use a Switch statement due to just checking one value against
                others.

                Think of it when comparing, here's a case not the object case like brief case but think of it like a
                file report for the police, does the case match the description of the case that you have for a value?
                No? Then move onto the next case. And do this until you either find a matching case or until you get to
                the ELSE equivalent (which is default instead of case).
