            <p>
                Next I'll be moving onto Logical Operators with the first one being the Logical AND operator. So what
                these operators allow us to do is combine different expressions or conditions to form one larger piece
                of logic. Could also just say combine two pieces of logic together to make a larger piece of logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 core logical operators built into JavaScript as well as many other programming languages.
                The three logical operators being AND, OR, and NOT. With this example though I'll be learning about the
                AND operator.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to write the AND operator would be "&&", this would join an expression on the left and an
                expression on the right. What this means is that it will NEED both condition one AND condition two to be
                true before the bigger condition both of these expressions are a part of to actually be considered true.
                I would need basically condition one true and condition two true. I can't have something like condition
                one true and then condition two false because then the overall expression would b considered false.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of this would be [if (age &gt;= 18 && age &lt; 24)], meaning that the condition is looking
                for the variable age to be GREATER than or EQUAL to 18 AND age to also be LESS than 24. Then the IF
                statements code would be ran. However if one of them is false then it will not run the code within the
                IF statement, the same goes for if the two conditions are false as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something else to notice is that I can have more than one of these within the condition, meaning I could
                have something like; Dogs is more than 3 AND Cats are more than 5 AND Rabbits are more than 12. Not only
                this but I can also have different Logical Operators within the same condition (Which is actually kind
                of really cool). Which then would allow me to do something like; Dogs is more than 3 AND Cats are more
                than 5 OR Rabbits is more than 12.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way for the Logical AND operator to get a true to run the code within the curly braces would be
                to have both or all conditions true, unles using something like an OR or NOT mixed in. But for now just
                thinking about two conditionals using the AND logical operator.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that in mind, the different ways in how Logical AND works would be the following; true && true =
                true, false && true = false, true && false = false, false && false = false. So for example I can play
                video games IF I have both finished my college work AND studied some coding. If I haven't done one of
                these or both of them then I CANNOT play video games.
