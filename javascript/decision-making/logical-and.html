                Next I'll be moving onto Logical Operators with the first one being the Logical AND operator. So what
                these operators allow us to do is combine different expressions or conditions to form one larger piece
                of logic. Could also just say combine two pieces of logic together to make a larger piece of logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 core logical operators built into JavaScript as well as many other programming languages.
                The three logical operators being AND, OR, and NOT. With this example though I'll be learning about the
                AND operator.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to write the AND operator would be "&&", this would join an expression on the left and an
                expression on the right. What this means is that it will NEED both condition one AND condition two to be
                true before the bigger condition both of these expressions are a part of to actually be considered true.
                I would need basically condition one true and condition two true. I can't have something like condition
                one true and then condition two false because then the overall expression would b considered false.
