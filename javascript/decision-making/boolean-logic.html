                Boolean logic is like making decision within JavaScript. Think of it as when you're not signed into
                reddit for example you will see generic sub reddits and posts compared to when you are signed in then
                you get to see specified content to that account. So when not signed in do one thing, when signed in do
                another thing.

        <h2>Comparisons</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                Moving onto comparisons now, using comparison operators, similar to how primitive operators work.
                Similar to how the plus sign or subtract operators work. These are built in to JavaScript but are not
                essentially for mathematical uses, I'm assuming they can be but I don't think they're fully for
                mathematic problems. Yeah so instead of doing math like adding two things together, these are used more
                or less to compare two things together.
            </p>
            <h3>List of Comparison Operators</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>&#62; - Greater than.</li>
                <li>&#60; - Less than.</li>
                <li>&#62;= - Greater than or equal to.</li>
                <li>&#60;= - Less than or equal to.</li>
                <li>== - Equality (Have the same value)</li>
                <li>!= - Not equal to.</li>
                <li>=== - Strict equality.</li>
                <li>!== - Strict non-equality.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <h4>&#62; and &#60; (&#62;= and &#60;=)</h4>
        <section>
            <p>
                I basically already know what these mean honestly, I've been learning about them for the past year now
                since I get them mixed up slightly still, but to think about it easier people tell you to just remember
                &#62; is greater than because the open side of the triangle is to the left side, whereas &#60; has the
                closed side to the left side. Meaning when you have something like 82 &#62; 67 then it's asking if 82 is
                greater than 67 and this case it would give me <span class="import">true</span> because 82 is greater
                than 67.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's just how I remembered it, it's basically what I said above. Moving on, if I was to try doing [-1
                &#62;
                -1;] then this would output false because -1 is not greater than itself, it's equal to itself. That's
                where &#62;= and &#60;= come in. For example if I was to use -1 &#62;= -1 then this would be true
                because it's not greater than but it is equal to. -1 &#62;= -1 in English means is -1 bigger than or the
                same amount as -1? Well the first one it's not but the second one it is.

                Interesting I can use these with Strings however, it's a little confusing and uncommon, the reason for
                this is mainly due to casing. However, for example when having 'a' < 'b' and getting the output of true.
                    I thought it did this because of binary but sadly that's not the case, it's a similar method and way
                    of thinking but a little simpler really. It's to do with Unicode, for example a in unicode has a
                    value of 61 and b has a value of 62. So it was a valid way of thinking, it just wasn't the correct
                    one. Just a heads up with Unicode, the Uppercase letters come before the Lowercase letters, meaning
                    Uppercase letters have a smaller Unicode value to Lowercase. </p>
                    <p>
                        Just note when doing comparisons with Unicodes that it might be doing something funky or acting
                        differently than I'm expecting because of the characters that might be in the String, some might
                        be bigger than I may expect.

            <h5>Double Equals (==)</h5>
            <p>
                Below is an explanation of double equals but honestly it's pretty confusing to me still.
            <ul>
                <li>Checks for equality of value, but not equality of type.</li>
                <li>It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them.</li>
                <li>This can lead to some unexpected results!</li>
            </ul>
            To put it simply, it checks if two values are equal, but doesn't care about the type (if they're the same).
            It will attempt to coerce two values, move them into being the same type which can give some unexpected
            results.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example 1 == 1 will give me true because 1 and 1 are both numbers and they're the same value.
                However, when trying something like 1 == '1' then these two value types are not the same, one is a
                number and the other is a String. Though this will still give an output of true because they're pretty
                close, they're both still containing the value of one, they just don't contain the same value type. This
                can be problematic though because this operator doesn't care about type, because it converts them to the
                same type and THEN compares.
            </p>
            <img src="../imgs/JavaScript Double Equals.png" alt="Examples of Double Equals being weird.">
            <p>
                The above image shows off how weird the double equals operator can be (yes I used an image because I'm
                lazy :D) however, it kind of makes sense to me. For example if you look at the second example 'b' == 'c'
                this is false and well this is because well they might be the same data type but double equals doesn't
                care about this it cares more about the value itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just tried 'test' and 'Test' which wouldn't work either because "T" has a different unicode to "t" so
                I should have seen this coming really. But for the most part it makes sense. 0 and '' giving the same
                output of true like above because they both are nothing really they're both not void but lack value in a
                sense. The one that doesn't really make sense to me is null and undefined really since they're different
                concepts but then again taken at base value they might just be the same as the 0 and '' (empty String)
                example. This will make more sense later apparently.
            </p>
            <h5>Triple Equals (===)</h5>
            <p>
                So this one is a little weird because you can do the samething with other operators but I'm sure there's
                a reason for this however, for now lets just explain this in the way I have figured out myself so far.
                It needs to have equality of both the value AND the type. Meaning the examples used in the last section
                won't give the true output like 0 and '', when using this operator it will not longer give the true
                output. Yeah I'm a little confused though since apparently != and !== do something the same or similar
                in some regard?
            </p>
            <p>
                With this it does not coerce the types to be of a similar type to each other. I'm kind of understanding
                this one but most likely need to figure it out a little more myself.
            </p>
            <h5>Not Equal (!=) And Strict Non-Equality (!==)</h5>
            <p>
                I basically already know this as well actually however, it seems a little different (maybe) within
                JavaScript. What I mean by different is that 1 != 2 would be true becuase 1 is not equal to two but if I
                was to try 1 != '1' then it would tell me it's false because the same thing again with Double Equals ,it
                doesn't care about the value types since it will coerce them to being similar, this again can cause some
                problems it just really depends if I'm wanting something to be very specific or just loosely specific.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's some examples: 1 != 2 (true, 1 is not the same as 2, disregarding type), 1 != '2' (true, because
                1 is not equal to 2 or the String two coerced into a similar data type), 1 != '1' (false, because !=
                doesn't care about the data type of the value since it will make both of them be similar to each other
                (or converts) and 1 is equal to 1 so it can't be not equal to 1), this makes sense to me currently but
                still. For example 1 != '1' (false, is equal so it can't be NOT equal to itself) is the opposite of
                doing 1 == '1' (true, it is equal).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, when using the strict (!==) equality version like !== on this example again 1 !== '1' this will
                also give us true but this is a little confusing honestly. Okay so I got a little bit of clarity
                regarding this, it seems there might be some use cases for one over the other when you might think that
                one of them is useless, when asking in the Discord of the course I'm taking, someone by the username
                "Ornable". Below is the answer they gave me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the time you should use strict comparison (Jordan here, this makes sense to me). You can view
                this <a href="https://shameem.me/strict-vs-loose-equality-in-javascript/">table</a> to see how loose
                equality works.
            <ul>
                <li>!= and !== means not equal to</li>
                <li>== and != is loose comparison, so for an example "1" == 1 is true</li>
                <li>=== and !== are strict comparison, so "1" ===1 is false</li>
            </ul>
