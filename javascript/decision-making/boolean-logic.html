            <p>
                Boolean logic is like making decision within JavaScript. Think of it as when you're not signed into
                reddit for example you will see generic sub reddits and posts compared to when you are signed in then
                you get to see specified content to that account. So when not signed in do one thing, when signed in do
                another thing.

        <h2>Comparisons</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                Moving onto comparisons now, using comparison operators, similar to how primitive operators work.
                Similar to how the plus sign or subtract operators work. These are built in to JavaScript but are not
                essentially for mathematical uses, I'm assuming they can be but I don't think they're fully for
                mathematic problems. Yeah so instead of doing math like adding two things together, these are used more
                or less to compare two things together.
            </p>
            <h3>List of Comparison Operators</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>&#62; - Greater than.</li>
                <li>&#60; - Less than.</li>
                <li>&#62;= - Greater than or equal to.</li>
                <li>&#60;= - Less than or equal to.</li>
                <li>== - Equality (Have the same value)</li>
                <li>!= - Not equal to.</li>
                <li>=== - Strict equality.</li>
                <li>!== - Strict non-equality.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <h4>&#62; and &#60;</h4>
        <section>
            <p>
                I basically already know what these mean honestly, I've been learning about them for the past year now
                since I get them mixed up slightly still, but to think about it easier people tell you to just remember
                &#62; is greater than because the open side of the triangle is to the left side, whereas &#60; has the
                closed side to the left side. Meaning when you have something like 82 &#62; 67 then it's asking if 82 is
                greater than 67 and this case it would give me <span class="import">true</span> because 82 is greater than 67.
