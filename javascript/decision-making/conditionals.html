            <p>
                So far I've done the internal and external setup along with some simple comparisons using the comparison
                operators. For example, 8 > 9; (false) would be a simple comparison. However, I haven't looked into what
                I can actually do with both answers right and wrong. But that's where if statements come in and I've
                already had a go at these in college and they're pretty straight forward and easy to get the hang of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically if the answer is this then do something, if it's not this then do something else in a very
                simple concept. And that's where these if statements come in.

            <p>
                In college I did something like [var Reply;] which just creates a variable called Reply with no value,
                then I did [Reply = prompt("What is the capital of Czechia (Czech Republic)?").toUpperCase();] which
                will give the user a prompt on the page load and have the question that is inside the String. Upon the
                user entering any input it will then set that input to the Reply variable and make it all upper case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is the if statement I used. If the user got the correct answer being "Prague" (which gets
                capitalised), then an alert will pop up saying "Correct.". However, anything else then they would get a
                different alert which says "Incorrect.".

                I'll get around to incorporating what I learn in college here as well as my self learning due to me
                currently learning more in college due to illness but this will change soon.

            <h3>Back To Udemy Course</h3>
            <p>
                The college stuff I did above is pretty basic stuff compared to what I can and will learn with this
                course I believe. Not only that but the stuff I can just learn myself by testing and having a go.
            </p>
            <p>
                So an IF statement is basically like a true or false statement, in the sense that it will run code if
                something is true and if not then it will do nothing (because it's the IF ELSE statment that runs some
                other code). Interesting so I'm not sure if this actually works but I'm going to test it. It seems I
                could have something like:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>[let dogs = 3;]</li>
                <li>[if (rating === 3) { console.log("Yeap I have " + dogs + " dogs!"); }]</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I might be able to use this to just run if it is true and then do nothing if it's not true. I was
                assuming I'd need an IF ELSE statement which I showed above for everything but that's not the case. For
                the exact thing I just said, what if I wanted code to only run if something was true? Then I'd just use
                the IF statement. The IF ELSE statment would be used for something different like if true then do thing
                1, if false (not true) then do thing 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll test this within the JavaScript file I made for this page. Inside the () for the IF statement,
                these would be called conditions. These conditions need to be met before doing x, y, or z.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to note is that the IF statement can be combined with ELSE, ELSE IF and be nested, so an IF
                statement could have another IF statement or ELSE/ELSE IF statment nested inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the condition is not met and it's false for the IF statement then only the code within that IFs curly
                braces does not get run, if there's code before or after this they will still get run. Technically this
                code does get run, it's just not needed as it's not true but the browser still reads it. Not ignored but
                not used kind of thing.
