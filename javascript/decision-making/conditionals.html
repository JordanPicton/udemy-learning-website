        <h2>If Statements</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                So far I've done the internal and external setup along with some simple comparisons using the comparison
                operators. For example, 8 > 9; (false) would be a simple comparison. However, I haven't looked into what
                I can actually do with both answers right and wrong. But that's where if statements come in and I've
                already had a go at these in college and they're pretty straight forward and easy to get the hang of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically if the answer is this then do something, if it's not this then do something else in a very
                simple concept. And that's where these if statements come in.

            <h3>College Understanding</h3>
            <p>
                In college I did something like [var Reply;] which just creates a variable called Reply with no value,
                then I did [Reply = prompt("What is the capital of Czechia (Czech Republic)?").toUpperCase();] which
                will give the user a prompt on the page load and have the question that is inside the String. Upon the
                user entering any input it will then set that input to the Reply variable and make it all upper case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is the if statement I used. If the user got the correct answer being "Prague" (which gets
                capitalised), then an alert will pop up saying "Correct.". However, anything else then they would get a
                different alert which says "Incorrect.".
            </p>

                I'll get around to incorporating what I learn in college here as well as my self learning due to me
                currently learning more in college due to illness but this will change soon.

            <h3>Back To Udemy Course</h3>
            <p>
                The college stuff I did above is pretty basic stuff compared to what I can and will learn with this
                course I believe. Not only that but the stuff I can just learn myself by testing and having a go.
            </p>
            <p>
                So an IF statement is basically like a true or false statement, in the sense that it will run code if
                something is true and if not then it will do nothing (because it's the IF ELSE statment that runs some
                other code). Interesting so I'm not sure if this actually works but I'm going to test it. It seems I
                could have something like:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>[let dogs = 3;]</li>
                <li>[if (rating === 3) { console.log("Yeap I have " + dogs + " dogs!"); }]</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I might be able to use this to just run if it is true and then do nothing if it's not true. I was
                assuming I'd need an IF ELSE statement which I showed above for everything but that's not the case. For
                the exact thing I just said, what if I wanted code to only run if something was true? Then I'd just use
                the IF statement. The IF ELSE statment would be used for something different like if true then do thing
                1, if false (not true) then do thing 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll test this within the JavaScript file I made for this page. Inside the () for the IF statement,
                these would be called conditions. These conditions need to be met before doing x, y, or z.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to note is that the IF statement can be combined with ELSE, ELSE IF and be nested, so an IF
                statement could have another IF statement or ELSE/ELSE IF statment nested inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the condition is not met and it's false for the IF statement then only the code within that IFs curly
                braces does not get run, if there's code before or after this they will still get run. Technically this
                code does get run, it's just not needed as it's not true but the browser still reads it. Not ignored but
                not used kind of thing.
            </p>

            <h2>(IF) ELSE Statements</h2>
            <p>
                Moving onto the ELSE statements, I've already talked a little about these during the IF statement so
                I should have a fairly decent overview into what these are and they're not that hard to understand or
                figure out honestly. (Compared to things like objects or OOP etc these seem pretty easy.)
            </p>
            <p>
                An ELSE statement is similar to an IF statement, where it looks for a condition and if that condition
                is met (true) then it will run some code inside the curly braces however, unlike the IF statement the IF
                ELSE statement can run different code if the condition is not met.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of this would be, a user loads up my website and a pop up occurs, it asks the user to input
                their age. Depending if the user puts 18+ (age >= 18) or not will determine what happens with the IF
                ELSE statment. Lets say the user puts in 18 (true), then the website will say thank you with an alert
                and load the website. However, is the user inputs something below 18 then they will get a different
                alert saying "Sorry you cannot access this website." and will redirect them to somewhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know the above example isn't really plausible since it's not hard to just put 18 into a prompt, but
                this is an example for a reason. Unlike the IF statement it's the second piece that is different,
                originally with the IF statement no code will be ran if the condition is false. But when having that
                ELSE there's another set of curly braces that has some more code that can be used when the condition is
                false, just like the example above.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will show this off within the linked script file, but I hope this will help when I come back around to
                actually making this into a proper project side and cleaning up my code etc.
            </p>

            <h2>ELSE IF Statements</h2>
            <p>
                ELSE statements come after this (In the course) one and I didn't quite realise that so I'll be doing
                these now and leave what I have above for the ELSE statements due to it being correct but I will go back
                through it just to double check before keeping it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either way lets get on with ELSE IF statements, I'm not really sure if I've done these before actually
                so this will be interesting and I don't really have a full good idea on what these could be really. I
                know they're to do with ELSE and IF statements. It might be as simple as them just being combined really
                and it probably is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interesting, so it seems similar to just an ELSE statement which is weird. "If not the first thing,
                maybe this other thing??" is what the basic description that Colt has on his slide. Okay so the way this
                works is if the first IF statement runs and fails that is when the ELSE IF statement will run. But then
                again this just sounds like an ELSE statement to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay so I think I understand this now, ELSE IF is basically similar to ELSE the only difference being is
                that ELSE doesn't allow for another condition it just looks for anything else that isn't expected. I'll
                be using the example Colt is using with his video.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of the code grabbing the week day and assigning that to a variable called "dayOfWeek", then in the
                first IF statement it would have the condition of [dayOfWeek === "Monday"] then it would print out in
                console that this is the first day of the week.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if I was to have an ELSE IF statement right after this with another condition like [dayOfWeek
                === "Tuesday"] then I could have an output of "This is the second day of the week.", and I can make more
                of these for the other days adding the other days as conditions like I've done with Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although if the code runs through to the end then I could just let it end there and then and nothing wll
                happen but I could also add an ELSE statement to the end to catch everything else that maybe input to
                the input and return a message telling them the options they have for the input. Below is the example
                made in the js file linked to this page.
            </p>
            <img src="../imgs/else-if-statement.png" alt="ELSE IF Statement made in the linked js file." />
            <p>
                As you can see with this I can have multiple conditions technically, although it does look a bit much
                and there's probably a better way in doing this but this is how I've used this to understand it.
                Something else that others are saying is that it's a slimmed down version of IF ELSE and that it's used
                "to specify a new condition to test, i the first condition is false."
