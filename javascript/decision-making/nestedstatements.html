                I've done some of this within college recently and it's interesting seeing how both this course and the
                college work just go hand in hand currently. I will be moving a bunch of my college work over to
                Obsidian but also over to this when it's needed. I just think it will be a good idea to keep it all in
                my head.

                So what this is, is basically I can nest conditionals inside conditionals. What this means is that I can
                basically have an IF statement nested within another IF statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the first example for these nested statements, we'll be asking a user for a password that will have
                two conditions. One is that the password MUST be 6+ characters and the other is that the password CANNOT
                include a space/white space character.
