                I've done some of this within college recently and it's interesting seeing how both this course and the
                college work just go hand in hand currently. I will be moving a bunch of my college work over to
                Obsidian but also over to this when it's needed. I just think it will be a good idea to keep it all in
                my head.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what this is, is basically I can nest conditionals inside conditionals. What this means is that I can
                basically have an IF statement nested within another IF statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the first example for these nested statements, I'll be asking a user for a password that will have
                two conditions. One is that the password MUST be 6+ characters and the other is that the password CANNOT
                include a space/white space character.
            </p>
            <p>
                With having the second IF condition inside the first IF condition it removes the redundancy of code that
                isn't needed. For example if I was to go on an airplane I would buy the ticket before actually getting
                through security. I wouldn't go through security and then get my ticket. This works in the same way, I
                only need to check if they have a space within the password if the password is 6 characters or over.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something interesting that I've noticed is that when the prompt pops up for the user input, then reading
                the console. It tells me that the password is null. Because it is empty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nesting isn't really bad but it can be a bit difficult to manage, but there is a better way to check for
                the example I've used (password), being a while loop I'm assuming, this is wrong he was talking about
                Logical AND, OR, and NOT, which I will be covering soon.
