            Moving onto nitty gritty part of JavaScript! Now I'll be learning about Console, Alert and Prompt. I have a
            vague idea of what the last two mean because you sometimes get a prompt which is like a warning on a website
            but I'm not fully sure if it's an alert or prompt I'm thinking of.
         </p>

            Basically I'll be learning how to run JavaScript code from a file, but also from a script within the HTML
            document aka an internal script.

         <h2>Console Logging</h2>
         <p>
            However I'll be starting with a new command which is console.log(), think of this as print("") from Python
            or System.out.println("") from Java. It does bascially the same thing and I'm actually really hyped to get
            started with it. It prints any arguement passed into it to the console. When typing in the console itself
            there's no need to use this however, when writing in a file and wanting to see specific values printed out
            this is the metod in which to do it.
