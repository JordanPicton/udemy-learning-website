            Moving onto nitty gritty part of JavaScript! Now I'll be learning about Console, Alert and Prompt. I have a
            vague idea of what the last two mean because you sometimes get a prompt which is like a warning on a website
            but I'm not fully sure if it's an alert or prompt I'm thinking of.
         </p>
         <p>
            Basically I'll be learning how to run JavaScript code from a file, but also from a script within the HTML
            document aka an internal script.
         </p>
         <h2>Console Logging</h2>
         <p>
            However I'll be starting with a new command which is console.log(), think of this as print("") from Python
            or System.out.println("") from Java. It does bascially the same thing and I'm actually really hyped to get
            started with it. It prints any arguement passed into it to the console. When typing in the console itself
            there's no need to use this however, when writing in a file and wanting to see specific values printed out
            this is the method in which to do it.
         </p>
         <p>
            So basically when working in the console on the browser itself, console.log() isn't needed, but if I'm
            wanting to see what is going on within a file that the html document links to then using console.log() at
            different points can give me an idicator into what is happening. Don't get to see live feedback from the
            internal script or the external file.
         </p>
         <p>
            Similar to how Math had a bunch of different things associated with it, console has some as well like .log
            which logs stuff to the console but there's also stuff like .clear which would clear the console. But then
            there's other stuff like .error and .warning which sound interesting and confusing at the same time. I'll
            learn about these in time though. .warning seems to put a Warning String within the console which is neat.
            It's similar to warning but a error styled warning basically.
         </p>
         <p>
            Another method to know is the alert method which shows a little pop-up message on the page for the website
            when it's used. I've seen these a lot and basically know how they work and what they do. Apparently these
            are really annoying and not recommended.
         </p>
         <p>
            The next being prompt which is like an alert box but with an input basically. Apparently these are used to
            save variables from the user and then they're used for a various amount of things for example it could be
            age, it's just like an input box basically. And then an alert can be run after it.
         </p>
         <p>
            I tried a little bit of this out at college, and I'll include what I found out below in the internal script
            element.
         </p>

</body>

<script>
   // So this is what I did in college, there's a variable defined here with age having the value of the prompt. But the age variable only looks for the input to save. And if there 
   // isn't one it will use the one provided, or of there isn't one provided then it would just be blank. However, age stores input and then can be used like any other variable which 
   // is demonstrated with the next line using the alert method. Which also brings me onto another method, the alert method, similar to the prompt method, just without the required
   // input, it just displays a message or text really.
   age = prompt("Insert your Age below!", "16");
   alert("You are " + age + " years old!");
