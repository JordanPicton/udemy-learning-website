            Moving onto the next part of JavaScript, this is all about Undefined and Null. I kind of already know what
            Null is due to other factors like Games and Programming Languages. Null basically means that it's nothing
            like a void. There is nothing set here nothing has been defined.
         </p>
         <p>
            Both Null and Undefined are primitive values, Null is an intentional abscense of a value, meaning the user
            must give a value of Null for Null to even be there otherwise it can't be assigned itself by JavaScript.
            Whereas Undefined is variables that do not have assigned values already.
         </p>
         <p>
            Typing "null" or "undfined" into the console via a browser will return that value, similar to how true and
            false works, however these aren't Strings or Booleans, they're their own values.
         </p>
         <p>
            I've seen undefined before too when doing the indices on Strings, when looking for a value at a certain
            indice that has nothing there it will give the value of Undefined, because something can be there but
            nothing is there as of currently. Another way to see this is when assigning a variable for example [let
            dog;] and then not actually giving it a value will result in undefined.
         </p>
         <p>
            Undefined is basically JavaScript saying it doesn't know the value, whereas Null is the intentional lack of
            a value.
         </p>
         <p>
            An example of Null could be something like [let loggedInUser = null;] meaning there is no value that should
            be here to begin with, however when a user logs in it could be something like [loggedInUser = 'Jordan
            Picton';]. Undefined does not mean nothingness like Null does, it's looking for a value but can't find it
            whereas with Null, well this is the value it's just null.
