      <h1>JavaScript Strings</h1>

   <main>
      <section>
         <p>
            So far I've messed around with two other primitive data types which were numbers and booleans however, now
            I'm going to mess around with my third which is a string and I've messed with Strings before, they're used
            through out different languages, I've seen them in both Java and Python so far and it's no surprise that
            JavaScript has them too.
         </p>
         <p>
            Strings are commonly used just as numbers and booleans, a String is basically a bunch of characters combined
            to create a word or in this case a String. Strings can also contain numbers and some special characters I
            believe, but if not I will correct myself later on. They represent text and must be wrapped in quotes.
            Wrapping them in quotes just explains to JavaScript that it's a String so then it knows what it's looking
            for.
         </p>
         <p>
            An example of using Strings in the WRONG way would be as follows, 'let username = jordan;' this would give
            me an error since JavaScript would be looking for double quotes for a String and not the singular quote that
            I have above. I'm just using these quotes to show that this between these is the example.
         </p>
         <p>
            An actual example of how this is supposed to be done is the following, 'let username = "jordan";' this again
            doesn't actually include the singular quote when used it's just show the example but the difference with
            this example is that I've included the double quotes which would actually tell JavaScript Hey look I'm a
            string.
         </p>
         <p>
            There's a few ways to make Strings, obviousy the double quotes (let firstName = "Jordan";) will work, (let
            msg = "Hey look this is a String!";), along with single quotes (let animal = 'Charlie Dog';) this will also
            work. However, I cannot mix and match for example (let badExample = "this will error;') this method will
            error meaning it is wrong and shouldn't be done.
         </p>
         <p>
            Something to note is that I've tested this with the console and it seems like doing this (let testing1 =
            "Does 'this' work?") actually works. Along with (let testing2 = 'But does "This" work?') and again yes this
            does work. Meaning as long as I close the quotes for the String and for the emphasis then it should work I
            just can't close the String quotes before the emphasis quote depending on what I'm using. Colt confirmed
            this for me.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are certain situations using certain quotations over the other wil make more sense but using the ones
            you're most comfortable with should be just fine. Though within a single JavaScript document I shouldn't be
            switching from double to single for basic Strings. Also just staying consistent is a good idea no matter
            what the case.
         </p>
         <p>
            Having a number in a String like this (let thisIsAStringNotNumber = "24";) this is still a String and not
            classed as a number meaning I cannot add this to another number so I shouldn't expect any adding or
            subtracting with this since it's specified as a String and not a Number.
         </p>
         <p>
            I can also have special characters within the string, so if I really wanted to I could have a String with
            the value of "This is classed as a String !!££$£$£%$^$%^" I had to remove the other double quotes though
            since that would close the string. So any special character that isn't the String closing character. Using
            one quote to close the other like so "'This is wrong' will cause JavaScript to throw a syntax error.
         </p>
         <p>
            Just to add onto the double quotes being used like this "Hello I am a String Error' think of it being
            similar to this ("Hello this doesn't have a closing quote.) they're basically the same thing. I'll be
            spending more time with Strings because there's more to them than there is to do with Numbers for example.
            Although I feel like both are going to be used extensively either way.
         </p>
         <p>
            Some stuff I'll be learning in the future is something called "Methods" not entirely sure if this is
            anything to do with String but I'll have to find out with more learning. There's also empty Strings which
            I've seen before which are basically like this "" and then long Strings.
         </p>

      <section>
         <h2>Indices And Length</h2>
         <p>
            Moving onto indices and length for Strings, I already basically know what this is which is where each
            character in a String is given a number and it starts from 0 and then inceases with each character by one.
            Yeah, I've done this before with Java so far and not really Python, so it works in the sense of what I said
            above and then you can pull characters based on the indice. Meaning if I have a String like this "Hello I am
            a String" and I was to pull the 5th indice, then it would give me the output of " " it wouldn't be "o"
            because this has the indice value of 4 since it begins at 0 and not 1.
         </p>
         <p>
            Strings being indexed means every character within said String has an index/indice value associated with it.
            Kind of how Microsoft Word will count how many characters are written in a paragrph if you select/highlight
            it. Only difference being that this value starts with the first character having the value of 0. Example of
            this is here: "Jordan", "012345". Imagine the numbers being directly under the name Jordan, those are the
            values given to each character within the name Jordan in this example. It's pretty straight forward. Indices
            values are also given to spaces like mentioned above and then also special characters.
         </p>
         <p>
            When using the console and after I have some Strings created, if I wanted to access the indice of a variable
            I created called name with the value of Jordan then to get the 3rd characters indice I would type something
            like "name[2]" 2 being the third in this case because it starts at 0 and not 1 remember. The output this
            would be "r" which is the 3rd character within that String.
         </p>
         <p>
            If I was to put something like name[10] (using the same variable example from above) and entered this I
            would get an undefined return since the String doesn't have 10 characters it only has the 6, looking for 10
            technically means the String would have to be 11 characters long but still it wouldn't give anything back
            since again it's only 6 characters long.
         </p>
         <p>
            Undefined is a special primitive value that I'll be learning about shortly, it's basically JavaScript
            telling us that there is currently nothing there I don't know what you want me to do. Normally indices
            aren't used in this manner, of showing where we know that a specific character is already there and want to
            know the number to find it, when we would already really know the number because we counted to get there
            and then take away 1.
         </p>
         <p>
            Usually indices are used to do something like, check the first character of a String, checking a phone
            number for example some people might input their phone number like so (+44)12345-67891011 or they might do
            it without, so we could use it to check if the first part of the String is a parentheses and most likely
            ignore this part, just getting the number itself.
         </p>
         <p>
            Normally when using this, it's not to try and find the first instance of something, it's normally used for
            what's the first character the last character, first half of the string etc. This is done via the method
            above the variable name with the square brackets with an index inside.
         </p>
         <p>
            Apparently something to note on Strings is that everyone of them have a "built in magical property" as Colt
            says, this being called length. So how this works is if I add this to the end of my variable for example
            name.length. If I was to do it like this then I would get a number value in return. Being the amount of
            characters within that String. Something else to remember is that using length, it counts in the way we
            count so it starts from 1.
         </p>
         <p>
            Meaning that name.length would give me a value of 6, with "n" being the final character but this means that
            when doing jordan[5] it would also give me an "n" just something to not forget about. Another thing to note
            is that if I want the length of a String without it being a variable then I can do something like "How long
            is this".length and this would work fine. Works the same for indices, "Hey I'm a String!"[2] would give the
            value of "y".
         </p>
         <p>
            I can also add Strings together, it works a bit differently than when trying to do it with numbers, but if I
            have two Strings and I add them together like this "Jordan" + "Picton" my output would be that of
            "JordanPicton", there's no space here because JavaScript has to be specifically told to use one.
         </p>
         <p>
            I would either put a space in one of the Strings I was adding together like "Jordan " + "Picton", or
            "Jordan" + " Picton". There is more ways of doing this but the only other one I know is similar to this
            being, "Jordan" + " " + "Picton" or firstName + " " + surName would also work. This is called concatenation,
            concatenating, shoving together two Strings. This creates a new String. I could also save the new String to
            a variable by doing let fullName = firstName + " " + surName; or et fullName = "Jordan" + " " + "Picton";
         </p>
         <p>
            Here's another example: "let firstName = 'John', let surName = 'Smith'" then I could add these together like
            so, "firstName" + "surName" which would value "JohnSmith" which is a new String. Check firstName and surName
            within the console would show that those two Strings have not changed.
         </p>
         <p>
            Apparently when defining a String like I have been "let firstName = 'Jordan'" I can't change that String,
            for example if I wanted to change Jordan to be jordan then I can't just update one character at a time
            within the String. Doing firstName = "jordan" is fine but this would be a completely new String. Apparently
            it's not worth understanding in the basic level of JS but it is useful to note and I'll be learning about
            this later either way. They look similar to us but they're different in memory.
         </p>
         <p>
            Can't update 1 character by itself manually, only way to do it really is by overwritting the entire
            character. I've done a bunch of concatenating with Java and it took a little time to get my head around it
            to begin with but I understand how it works now.
         </p>
         <p>
            When doing something like 1 + "Hi" it gave a value I wasn't expecting since 1 is a number and "Hi" is a
            String. It gave the output of "1Hi" which is also a String, and also kind of weird since I wasn't expecting
            this honestly. Lets say I was to give this a variable for example "let test = 1 + 'Hi'" then tried doing
            "typeof test" it would tell me that this is a String because it would look like "1Hi"
         </p>
         <p>
            So why does it give a String and not a number or both? Well it's something I'll learn again later but for
            now put basically it's JavaScript trying to find the common ground between the two and then giving them both
            that common ground, which in this case would be to make them both a String.
         </p>

         <h2>String Methods</h2>
         <p>
            Now for a bigger topic, String Methods. These are things that are built in ACTIONS I can perform on
            individual Strings. They allow us to Search within a String, Replace part of a String, and Change the casing
            of a String like Upper or Lower case. Actions, called Methods. Every String has all of these. The way to see
            these Methods easily is by going into my web browser and then doing "hello". having the period right after
            the String will bring up a bunch of different Methods that can be used on the String. Also checking MDN for
            this will give me a more in-depth understanding.
         </p>
         <p>
            There's only one property for Strings which I've already seen and talked about called length. As for
            methods, well lets just say there's a boat load and then the rest. They can also allow me to capitalise a
            String etc. The syntax for this looks like thing.method(). thing being the String or String variable name
            and then method obviously being the method I want applied to this String.
         </p>
         <h3>String Property (Length)</h3>
         <p>
            When using .length above it looks very similar in regards to how to use a method on a String, the difference
            being that there are parentheses at the end of the method name. Without the parentheses, it's how I would
            access a property. But when using the parentheses, it's how I'd execute a method, the syntax for this
            looking like thing.property.
         </p>
         <h3>String Casing Methods</h3>
         <p>
            Trying a simple method on a String, which will be casing. I'll have something like [let name = "jordan";]
            but lets say there's a place where I want this to show as in all uppercase. Then to do this I would just do
            something like [name.toUpperCase();] and it would give the output of JORDAN, but the actual value of the
            String name would stay the same as the original (jordan). There's also the opposite of this, for example if
            I had [let surname = "PICTON";] and used this method instead [surname.toLowerCase();] it would give me the
            output of "picton".
         </p>
         <p>
            Using the examples above, I could also do something like [let fullName = name.toUpperCase() + surname;]
            which would give me the output of "JORDANPICTON" (I think, I'll double check this, yeah this worked as I've
            stated here.)
         </p>
         <p>
            The next one I'll be looking into is called Trim, this can be useful for example, getting input from a user,
            or just dealing with data. What it does is trims off any excess white space at the beginning or end of a
            String. An example of this in action would basically be [let test = " This has white space! ";] and then
            using this String with the method [test.trim();], giving the output of "This has white space!" however, the
            original String stays the same. This only removes whitespace and not other characters. An example of this
            would be "____Hello____", this would stay the same when using the Trim method. Something to note is that
            this doesn't remove the spaces in between words, just the excess on the beginning and end.
         </p>
         <h3>Chaining Methods</h3>
         <p>
            I can chain methods together for example if I wanted to trim a String and then make it all uppercase, I'd be
            able to do this by doing the following [let testTwo = " This is another test !!!!";], I'm actually curious
            to see if it would trim the white space in the middle of the words there. Using trim to try and trim the
            white space in the middle of a String does not work and chaining works like so
            [testTwo.trim().toUpperCase();]
         </p>
         <p>
            When chaining methods together, it's useful to remember that the code reads from left to right, meaning what
            comes first is what applies first. For the example used above, testTwo = This is another test!!!!, .trim() =
            remove any useless white space, .toUpperCase() = THIS IS ANOTHER TEST!!!!. So the toUpperCase comes after
            the trim method.
         </p>
         <p>
            I'll give another example of this here. For example this time lets have something like [let dog =
            "Charlie";].
         <ul>
            <li>dog = Charlie</li>
            <li>dog.trim(); = Charlie (Without extra spaces, it's hard to show on here due to VSC removing white space
               when I'm formatting)</li>
            <li>dog.trim().toUpperCase(); = CHARLIE</li>
         </ul>
         Think of it giving the output after every step, for instance dog would output the value of Charlie and then the
         method would be used, but the code doesn't show you these steps when it's running through. It's just something
         to be mindful of. Chaining methods together is pretty common for JavaScript.
         </p>
         <h3>String Methods With Arguements</h3>
         <p>
            Okay so I've done JavaScript methods for example .toUpperCase() is a method. However, you see those
            brackets? With nothing inside of them? Well those actually accept something called an argument, these modify
            the behaviour of the method, think of them as inputs and they're inside the parentheses. I kind of figured
            out how these work already.
         </p>
         <p>
            For example if I have the example from earlier "dog" which has the output of "Charlie" and I wanted to run
            the .toUpperCase() method on this again but this time I only wanted the letters/characters "L" to change to
            uppercase then I would do something like this dog.toUpperCase('l');. Okay this technically would work but
            for uppercase or lowercase it won't work. So my idea is right it just won't work for this method.
         </p>
         <p>
            But it would work for the method indexOf(), and there's a good slide showing this off that in the course.
            I'll use the same example I have been using in the past little while here, so if I have "dog" and I want to
            find out the index of the letter "r" then I would do something like dog.indexOf('r');. However, I would also
            be able to use it like this dog.indexOf('lie'); and this would work, it would basically look for the first
            instance of the group of characters in that formation "l i e" without the spaces obviously. So if there was
            an "l" character before this, and it's looking for lie then it wouldn't give the index of the first l
            character because that isn't the arguement.
         </p>
         <p>
            When using the arguement and using a character or string of characters together and they're not within the
            actual String or variable then it will output -1 meaning there's none to be found. IndexOf is mainly used to
            test if something contains something.
         </p>
         <p>
            Moving onto a new and more complicated looking method that uses arguments, it's called slice it seems to
            have two acceptable arguments or just the one. Always remember to refer to MDN documentation when struggling
            because they're really useful when it comes to figuring something out. Or just giving more information on
            something.
         </p>
         <p>
            Slice is used to remove or extract a portion of a String. I'll be using a different example for this being,
            [let exampleOne = "This is just another test example I'll be using since it's a long String.";]. After slice
            has removed the part/portion of the String we asked, it will return it as a new String to us but will NOT
            alter the original.
