            So far I've messed around with two other primitive data types which were numbers and booleans however, now
            I'm going to mess around with my third which is a string and I've messed with Strings before, they're used
            through out different languages, I've seen them in both Java and Python so far and it's no surprise that
            Javascript has them too.
         </p>
         <p>
            Strings are commonly used just as numbers and booleans, a String is basically a bunch of characters combined
            to create a word or in this case a String. Strings can also contain numbers and some special characters I
            believe, but if not I will correct myself later on. They represent text and must be wrapped in quotes.
            Wrapping them in quotes just explains to JavaScript that it's a String so then it knows what it's looking
            for.
         </p>
         <p>
            An example of using Strings in the WRONG way would be as follows, 'let username = jordan;' this would give
            me an error since JavaScript would be looking for double quotes for a String and not the singular quote that
            I have above. I'm just using these quotes to show that this between these is the example.
         </p>
         <p>
            An actual example of how this is supposed to be done is the following, 'let username = "jordan";' this again
            doesn't actually include the singular quote when used it's just show the example but the difference with
            this example is that I've included the double quotes which would actually tell Javascript Hey look I'm a
            string.
