            So far I've messed around with two other primitive data types which were numbers and booleans however, now
            I'm going to mess around with my third which is a string and I've messed with Strings before, they're used
            through out different languages, I've seen them in both Java and Python so far and it's no surprise that
            JavaScript has them too.
         </p>
         <p>
            Strings are commonly used just as numbers and booleans, a String is basically a bunch of characters combined
            to create a word or in this case a String. Strings can also contain numbers and some special characters I
            believe, but if not I will correct myself later on. They represent text and must be wrapped in quotes.
            Wrapping them in quotes just explains to JavaScript that it's a String so then it knows what it's looking
            for.
         </p>
         <p>
            An example of using Strings in the WRONG way would be as follows, 'let username = jordan;' this would give
            me an error since JavaScript would be looking for double quotes for a String and not the singular quote that
            I have above. I'm just using these quotes to show that this between these is the example.
         </p>
         <p>
            An actual example of how this is supposed to be done is the following, 'let username = "jordan";' this again
            doesn't actually include the singular quote when used it's just show the example but the difference with
            this example is that I've included the double quotes which would actually tell JavaScript Hey look I'm a
            string.
         </p>
         <p>
            There's a few ways to make Strings, obviousy the double quotes (let firstName = "Jordan";) will work, (let
            msg = "Hey look this is a String!";), along with single quotes (let animal = 'Charlie Dog';) this will also
            work. However, I cannot mix and match for example (let badExample = "this will error;') this method will
            error meaning it is wrong and shouldn't be done.
         </p>
         <p>
            Something to note is that I've tested this with the console and it seems like doing this (let testing1 =
            "Does 'this' work?") actually works. Along with (let testing2 = 'But does "This" work?') and again yes this
            does work. Meaning as long as I close the quotes for the String and for the emphasis then it should work I
            just can't close the String quotes before the emphasis quote depending on what I'm using. Colt confirmed
            this for me.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are certain situations using certain quotations over the other wil make more sense but using the ones
            you're most comfortable with should be just fine. Though within a single JavaScript document I shouldn't be
            switching from double to single for basic Strings. Also just staying consistent is a good idea no matter
            what the case.
         </p>
         <p>
            Having a number in a String like this (let thisIsAStringNotNumber = "24";) this is still a String and not
            classed as a number meaning I cannot add this to another number so I shouldn't expect any adding or
            subtracting with this since it's specified as a String and not a Number.
         </p>
         <p>
            I can also have special characters within the string, so if I really wanted to I could have a String with
            the value of "This is classed as a String !!££$£$£%$^$%^" I had to remove the other double quotes though
            since that would close the string. So any special character that isn't the String closing character. Using
            one quote to close the other like so "'This is wrong' will cause JavaScript to throw a syntax error.
         </p>
         <p>
            Just to add onto the double quotes being used like this "Hello I am a String Error' think of it being
            similar to this ("Hello this doesn't have a closing quote.) they're basically the same thing. I'll be
            spending more time with Strings because there's more to them than there is to do with Numbers for example.
            Although I feel like both are going to be used extensively either way.
         </p>
         <p>
            Some stuff I'll be learning in the future is something called "Methods" not entirely sure if this is
            anything to do with String but I'll have to find out with more learning. There's also empty Strings which
            I've seen before which are basically like this "" and then long Strings.

         <h2>Indices And Length</h2>
         <p>
            Moving onto indices and length for Strings, I already basically know what this is which is where each
            character in a String is given a number and it starts from 0 and then inceases with each character by one.
            Yeah, I've done this before with Java so far and not really Python, so it works in the sense of what I said
            above and then you can pull characters based on the indice. Meaning if I have a String like this "Hello I am
            a String" and I was to pull the 5th indice, then it would give me the output of " " it wouldn't be "o"
            because this has the indice value of 4 since it begins at 0 and not 1.
         </p>
         <p>
            Strings being indexed means every character within said String has an index/indice value associated with it.
            Kind of how Microsoft Word will count how many characters are written in a paragrph if you select/highlight
            it. Only difference being that this value starts with the first character having the value of 0. Example of
            this is here: "Jordan", "012345". Imagine the numbers being directly under the name Jordan, those are the
            values given to each character within the name Jordan in this example. It's pretty straight forward. Indices
            values are also given to spaces like mentioned above and then also special characters.
         </p>
         <p>
            When using the console and after I have some Strings created, if I wanted to access the indice of a variable
            I created called name with the value of Jordan then to get the 3rd characters indice I would type something
            like "name[2]" 2 being the third in this case because it starts at 0 and not 1 remember. The output this
            would be "r" which is the 3rd character within that String.
         </p>
         <p>
            If I was to put something like name[10] (using the same variable example from above) and entered this I
            would get an undefined return since the String doesn't have 10 characters it only has the 6, looking for 10
            technically means the String would have to be 11 characters long but still it wouldn't give anything back
            since again it's only 6 characters long.
         </p>
         <p>
            Undefined is a special primitive value that I'll be learning about shortly, it's basically JavaScript
            telling us that there is currently nothing there I don't know what you want me to do. Normally indices
            aren't used in this manner, of showing where we know that a specific character is already there and want to
            know the number to find it, when we would already really know the number because we counted to get there
            and then take away 1.
         </p>
         <p>
            Usually indices are used to do something like, check the first character of a String, checking a phone
            number for example some people might input their phone number like so (+44)12345-67891011 or they might do
            it without, so we could use it to check if the first part of the String is a
