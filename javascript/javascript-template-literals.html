            Moving onto something called JavaScript Template Literals, I've never heard of these before so it'll be
            interesting.
         </p>
         <p>
            If I wanted to do something like [let game = "Terraria";], [let price = 7.99;], [let quantity = 10;].
            Let's say I have these variables and I want to make something out of them it would looke something like
            ["You bought " + quantity + " " + game + "copies. Total is: " + price * quantity;] giving the output of "You
            bought 10 Terraria copies. Total is: 79.9".
         </p>
         <p>
            Doing this the way above is very time consuming and is unnecessary. There's a better way in doing this. And
            you guessed it, it's the Template Literal that I'm learning about right now. These Template Literals are
            newer syntax to JavaScript. They allow us to create Strings, embed an expression inside the String and then
            that expression will be evaluated and turned into a String.
         </p>
         <p>
            An example of this would be something like [`She had ${5 + 3} puppies!`;] giving the output of "She had 8
            puppies!". So the "${5 + 3}" gets evaluated and then turned into a String. Something to note, to get this to
            work you have to use the ` characters which is the button underneath escape (no holding shift, alt, or
            control).
         </p>
         <p>
            We can also just make a String with these backticks by doing `Hello` this would be classed as a String. The
            special thing about these backticks however, is that when using this "${}" whatever goes inside of these
            curly braces will be treated as an expression. Allowing it to get evaluated. A quick example of this would
            be something like [`test ${1 + 6}`;], which would print out "test 7".
         </p>
         <p>
            Just to be clear, using the backtick character allows this to be evaluated however, if I was to use the same
            example above and show the output of it using single quotes then it would look exactly like what was typed
            in being "test ${1 + 6}". It wouldn't get evaluated and would just print out the part of the evaluation
            without it actually getting evaluated. (What comes out is exactly what was put in, when using single
            quotes.)
         </p>
         <p>
            If I was to go back to the beginning and recreate the String with the knowledge I have now, it would look
            something like [`You bought ${quantity} ${game} copies. Total is: ${price * quantity}.`]. As you can see
            this is way nicer looking and just less work. It's like putting variables into a String and then not having
            to worry too much about opening and closing the double quotes all the time for spaces etc. Something else to
            know which is pretty neat is, using the example above again. [`You bought ${quantity} ${game.toUpperCase();}
            copies. Total is: ${price * quantity}.`] I can use methods inside this, as shown via the game variable and
            giving it the toUpperCase() method.
         </p>
         <p>
            These are actually pretty cool. :D
