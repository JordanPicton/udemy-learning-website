        This is another data structure that is similar to an array, it allows for the combination of multiple pieces of
        data together, along with different types of data. There are two main topics within this section being "Creating
        & Working with Object Literals" and "Nesting Arrays & Objects". Objects are generally simpler than arrays
        without the push, pop etc.

        These being the second data structure I'll be touching after learning about arrays, they allow the storage of
        multiple pieces of data in a sort of structure.
