        This is another data structure that is similar to an array, it allows for the combination of multiple pieces of
        data together, along with different types of data. There are two main topics within this section being <a
          href="creating-and-working-with-object-literals.html">Creating & Working with Object Literals</a> and <a
          href="nesting-arrays-and-objects.html">Nesting Arrays & Objects</a>.
        Objects are generally simpler than arrays without the push, pop etc.
