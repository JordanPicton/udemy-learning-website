        This is another data structure that is similar to an array, it allows for the combination of multiple pieces of
        data together, along with different types of data. There are two main topics within this section being "Creating
        & Working with Object Literals" and "Nesting Arrays & Objects". Objects are generally simpler than arrays
        without the push, pop etc.

      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        These being the second data structure I'll be touching after learning about arrays, they allow the storage of
        multiple pieces of data in a sort of structure. Unlike arrays to where the whole idea is to order the data, like
        having a first, second, third and fourth thing etc. Instead the data is stored using things called key-value
        pairs or properties with a property being two pieces of information. One piece being the key and the other being
        a value. With these keys and values together they form pairs, some examples would be key: value "age: 20",
        "city: 'London'", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are restrictions when it comes to these but they'll be talked about later. But an object is just a bunch
        of these pairs together, though the pairs do not have to be ordered. So you can store these pairs within an
        object and retrieve them using a custom key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of using the example that Colt uses I'm going to use a different one which is instead of thinking about
        storing the stats of a fit bit or something similar. In my case I want to imagine storing Minecraft data, like
        the players statistics, I'm using this as my example because this, funny enough, is the thing that got me
        interested within coding to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
        A way to store these stats would be to use an array like so "[452321, 826482, 3249]" by just looking at this
        array, it doesn't really tell you much of what each piece of data is or does. A better way to do this would be
        with objects which are the things I'm going to be learning about and has peaked my interest again. With using an
        object I will be able to label things so then I have an idea to what the data corresponds to. Kind of how giving
        a variable a good name helps with understanding what the variable does.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've looked a little into the next steps of the object and they seem pretty good/easily understandable which is
        nice to know.

        With the image above you can see that this is an example of an object, though not mine (it's Colts from the
        course) you can see how the key and the value are linked. It's through the ":" colon. Something else that is
        interesting is that the entire object is set to a constant. I'm interested to know if these objects can be
        manipulated even though it's a constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it's the Key AND Value, it's called a pair remember. With regards to the example above, the properties are
        in no given order. Along with all being inside one object. The properties in the example are stored within an
        object with the name of "fitBitData".
      </p>
      <p>
        Property = Key + Value. To get the data out we need to know the key. Structurally storing data like this within
        an array doesn't make much sense. Thats where these objects come in.
