            <p>
                So I have a pretty good understanding to how these work already honestly thanks to some dabbling in some
                Java and Python. It's where you can store one piece of data in human language in a sense, for example if
                I needed to store the age of someone then I would be able to say something like age = (randomNumber),
                then instead of using (randomNumber) I would be able to use just age. I can reuse it, and even change
                the number later on.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's just a way of simplifying the code to make it easier so then I don't have to remember the actual
                piece of data itself and I can use simplified English basically. The syntax for this would be the
                following; "let someName = value;". The example Colt gives within the course is "let year = 1985", using
                the word year instead of 1985 is easier to remember than the year all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                So using the console, I can set some different variables which I won't actually do here since they'll be
                forgotten when I reload the page. However, I will note down what will happen here. For starters let's
                make our first variable which is let servers = 7. With our first variable complete I'll make a second
                one; lets pis = 5. With this I could then make another variable which could be like this; let
                totalMachines = servers + pis. If I was to get the output of totalMachines I would get the number 12
                since what it's doing is basically adding the two variables (servers and pis) together to give me the
                number 12 for total machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I wanted to update one of the two variables (servers or pis) then the way I would do this is simply
                to do this servers = 8; so instead of servers being 7 it would now be updated to equal 8. Or another way
                to do this is by the way I thought of doing it which is servers = servers + 1, which would increment the
                servers value by + 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, if I was to run totalMachines I would not get the update value. I would still get the
                same value I got when I set the totalMachines variable last. So for example if I was to run it right now
                without any update after creating it, the value I would get would still be 12. However if I was to run
                the same variable command again for totalMachines now, then I would get the updated value of 13. Kind of
                behaves in a different way I believe but I could be wrong. It's like the variable takes a snapshot of
                what I set it to originally and doesn't update jsut because one of the other variables updated since
                they're not properly linked.
            </p>

            <h2>Updating Variables</h2>
            <p>
                Touching on more about how to update variables, well mainly talking about numbers still for now. Since I
                can store more things in a variable like strings, booleans etc. So let's begin by creating a new number
                variable, I'll be following the one from Colt since I'm not creative. Firstly lets create a variable
                called score and set it to 0. "let score = 0;" score is now set to equal 0, but now I want to add 5 so
                let's do that by doing "score = 5;".
            </p>
            <p>
                This would only work the first time since score was originally set to 0. If I was to do this again for
                example "score = 8" then score would now equal 8 and will have overidden the 5 from earlier, this is why
                I can only do this the first time. After doing that for the first time if I want to change the value of
                score by increasing or descreasing it I would need to do something like the following "score = score +
                5" which would now give me the output of 10 since I'm not counting the part where I set it to 8 since
                that was an example and explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way this works, is like this; "let score = 0" (the variable gets created with the value of 0),
                "score = 5" (then score gets given the value of 5), "score = score + 5" (then score is given the value
                of score which is currently 5 then 5 is added to this giving score the new value of 10). Everytime I
                want to add something to score I can do it like this and it can be another number like 21 for example
                which if I was to do that right now it would give me the total of 31. This also works for subtraction
                which would look like "score = score - 2" which in this case would give score the value of 8.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there is a easier and shorter way in doing this and it looks a little something like "score +=
                5" what this means is score, set it equal to score + 5. It's just the short hand of doing what I've been
                doing up above but condensed. And subtraction would look something like "score -= 5" which would take
                away 5 from score. There are other operators I can use in the same way, for example I've already shown
                addition +=, then subtraction -=, there's multiplication *=, and division /=.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within coding, it's very common to increment and decrement a value by 1, so + 1 or - 1. For now I'll
                create a new variable (I say this but for now I'm just typing it here) called numLives, again folloiwng
                Colt. "let numLives = 9;" as you can see I've created a variable called numLives which has a value of 9.
                I'm going to increment and decrement this. Lets say I lose a life then I would do something like this
                "numLives -= 1;" however, there's a simpler version for this even. If I'm only adding or subtracting 1
                then there's a way simpler way to do this, I learned it with Java and knowing it works in Javascript is
                really cool to know honestly. But the way I can do this simple version is by doing "numLives--" to take
                1 away from the value of numLives or to add I would do the following: "numLives++". I remember doing
                this in Java so it's pretty simple to understand.
            </p>

            <h2>i++ vs ++i</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the increment or decrement operators placement it can change when the number value gets
                return, before before or after the increment/decrement. First off starting with i++, this is know as the
                post increment operator meaning you write the variable name and then the operator. When this is used it
                returns the current value of the variable and then increments it by one.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example if I set the variable "i" to 0, "let i = 0". Then doing "i++" would print out 0 in the
                console, but it would have a value of 1 after printing this out. I've just tested it in the console to
                make sure I fully understood it and I do. Basically i++ prints the variable then increments. Meaing I
                don't get to see the updated number because the increment comes after the variable is printed. To fix
                this I can do ++i which baically increments i by 1 to the original value of i and then prints out the
                variable. Meaning I get to see the increment in real time rather than having to double check by typing
                the variable again. A little finicky but it's not too bad honestly since it is pretty straight forwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                One more thing about this is that, when doing something like i++ (between the square brackets is the
                value given) this is what happens "let i = 5", "let result = i++", "result [5]", "i [6]", running
                "result"
                increments i by 1 but then I have to run i in console to check if it actually incremented i.
            </p>
            <p>
                The better way to do this is the following "let i = 5", "let result = ++i", "result [6]", "i [6]". As
                shown I don't need to run i at the end to see the updated value since the value is printed out after the
                increment. Works for decrement too, kind of straight forward in that regard.
            </p>

            <h2>Const And Var</h2>
            <p>
                I've already set a variable with the keyword "let" like so "let variableName = 3;", but there are other
                ways I can variables, and I believe they each have their different uses.
            </p>
            <h3>Const</h3>
            <p>
                Starting with Const which stands for constant, it does exactly what you think it does, it's works in the
                same way let does so I can use it like "const variableName = 3;" the only difference being that I CANNOT
                change the value of this. So I can't increment or decrement this number or add other numbers to it etc.
                It's a constant meaning that it's constant, what a shocker.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of errors and things I cannot do with a constant. First off is trying to change
                the variable directly, for example; "const chairs = 4;", and then trying "chairs = 8;" this would give
                me an error bcause I can't change the constant. The same thing would happen if I was to try changing the
                value in the following way; "const people = 23;", "people = people + 1;", this would also error since I
                CANNOT change a constant! Another way I can't change this is by doing this "const dogs = 3;", "dogs +=
                1;", this again would not work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The error I would get would be something like this "Type Error: Assignment to constant variable." The
                use case for const may seem very limited but it's actually really useful for when you want something to
                stay the same. Some good example of this are; "daysInWeek = 7;", "feetInMile = 5280;". There are use
                cases for these, just a good idea to keep them in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I go over Arrays and Objects, then I'll see more use cases where const would make more sense than
                using let. Javascript will yell at me for trying to change a const and will not let me.
            </p>
            <h3>Var</h3>
            <p>
                Moving on Var, which is interesting since it just stands for variable I believe. It seems like this is
                an old variable keyword, before let and const. Var was the only way of declaring variables but with let
                and var there's no real point in using it anymore. This keyword still works, but there's not much point
                in using it. Var will be better explained later one when I learn more about different methods and topics
                about Javascript, there should be no real reason to use Var anymore.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                With what I know right now let is used to make a variable that I can reassign, const is used for making
                a variable unchangeable, and var just shouldn't be used really. Eventually I'll find out that const is
                more useful than what I've seen so far.
