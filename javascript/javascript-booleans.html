                Booleans, I've learnt about these in college, Java and Python now, they're everywhere in programming.
                The reason for this is because they're needed, kind of like the increment and decrement from the numbers
                etc. What a boolean is, it's very much simply a true or false and that's all it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah so that's basically it with a boolean I either write true or false depending on what I'm wanting.
                For example "let isLoggedIn = true;", "let isGameOver = false;", "const isWaterWet = true;". This is
                literally how to set a variable to a boolean aka true or false.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typing any random word within the console will most likely give me an error however, when typing in true
                of false, the syntax of the word changes. Depending on the browser it can be a different colour or
                italics etc. They just look different in the console from other words. Also when typing them in I don't
                get an error. When typing in true or false by themselves it just repeats the word back to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later on I'll see how these can be very useful in the regards to logic and providing different outcomes
                etc. Along with decisions, but at the core they're very simple but used a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples of using this could be in game design, think about ifPlayerIsAlive, isGameStillActive etc.
                There's a bunch of things I can store using booleans and they would come in handy deciding what is best
                in different areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: "let gameStillActive = true;" and then gameStillActive would give the output of true, until I
                go in and change it by doing something like "gameStillActive = false;" now this would have the value of
                false.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to is that true and false are lower case. Trying to use true and false like this True, False
                then it would error saying True or False is not defined, depending on which one I type. Another use case
                could be "let isLoggedIn = false;" is a common and very important use case for websites to check if a
                user is logged into the webite or not.
