                With Javascript there's a lot of different parts compared to CSS and HTML. Just to recap, HTML, CSS and
                Javascript are the 3 main tools when building the frontend of a website. Javascript is like the Verbs
                for web development, where as HTML was the nouns and CSS was the adjectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Javascript is a lot more logic heavy along with being a bit more creative in some ways, and I'll be
                using Javascript throughout the course from now on. First I'll be learning how to use Javascript on it's
                own which will be isolated from CSS and HTML. However, then I'll be moving into making Javascript
                interact and manipulate HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something I want to add to this before moving on is that at the end of doing some code for example
                [console.log("Hello");]. See the semi-colon at the end there? ";" this thing, well it's not really 100%
                needed. Having them and not having them does work, I'm not really sure if they're actually needed or not
                though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Asking the Colts community about this, it seems that they're not needed however, they're used for more
                of a "easy to read" kind of thing. Which I'm assuming just means they're used to see when a certain
                piece of code has ended, think of it as a full stop almost, for code.

            <h2>Basics of Javascript</h2>
            <h3>Primitive Types</h3>
            <p>The basic building blocks. What this includes of is listed below, but it's the foundation of Javascript
                essentially. The last two in the list are less commonly used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="javascript-numbers.html">Numbers</a></li>
                <li><a href="javascript-strings.html">String</a></li>
                <li><a href="javascript-booleans.html">Boolean</a></li>
                <li>Null</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>Symbol</li>
                <li>BigInt</li>

            <h3>Starting Off</h3>
            <p>
                To begin, I'll be running Javascript code within the console via Firefox Web Development Edition since
                this is what I am used to using and have been using throughout this course. But using the console window
                allows me to test some Javascript code in an isolated case. I will show the code off here and explain
                what it does here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting off in the console, I can write some basic code in here, for example; 1+1 and it would respond
                with the answer being 2. The code is run when submitting and then the answer is read back to me using
                something called REPL, meaning Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop. Using the console isn't the best place to
                keep code or write code if it's what I want to keep, as soon as I close the window the code will no
                longer be there or saved. So I'll be working in files sooner rather than later so then I can explain
                things in detail etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples that could be used with Javascript are things like the subscribe buton on YouTube or even
                the like and dislike buttons they are on each video or even the views counter.
            </p>

            <h3>Commenting</h3>
            <p>
                Something that I learn in the <a href="javascript-numbers.html">Numbers</a> section is that to comment
                something out in Javascript, all I need to do is use "//" without the quotation marks. This will be
                helpful for when I start writing some actual Javascript and want to comment on it like I have with HTML,
                CSS and not really Bootstrap. There's also no need in writing these in console when using the console to
                test since they're not ran and just ignored.
