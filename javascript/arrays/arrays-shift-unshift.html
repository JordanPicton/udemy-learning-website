                Now moving onto the Shift and Unshift methods. Just like Push and Pop which do something at the end of
                the array kind of like being a pair almost because they both do something to the end of the array, just
                differently. Shift and Unshift are also kind of a pair in regards to doing something to the beginning of
                the array, meaning they both do something at the start of the array but it's not the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to is that Unshift sounds like it removes something from the array however, that's shifts job.
                I assume it's because it shifts something out of the way and gets rid of it but I'm just speculating,
                since Unshift is the method to add something to the array instead. In this respect it can be a little
                confusing but Shift is to remove first element from array and Unshift is to add something to the start
                of the array.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like always I've added the respective script for this web page to test within. I've done a few tests
                with the normal singular addition and removal however, I did some other tests which some worked like the
                multiple unshift test where I added more than one piece of data, another unshift test where I added more
                than one data type to the array and these both worked. When trying to remove more than one element with
                the shift method, this didn't seem to work as I thought it would. I tried putting a number between the
                parenthesis because I've seen other methods or functions use this and this does not work this way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like the Pop method, when using the shift method it returns the value of the element/data it's
                remove meaning this can be stored in a Variable if needed later or use. Done by doing variableName =
                arrayName.push();. Trying to shift or pop from an empty array will give the undefined data type as a
                return, meaning there'll be no error.
            </p>
            <p>
                So to just recall, Unshift = add to the beginning of the array, Shift = remove from the beginning of the
                array. Push = add to the end of the array, Pop = remove from the end of the array. These can be used in
                conjunction to mimic things like a queue like a queue of people. These methods are also pretty commonly
                used. I'll make a better note/cleaner note on these on my website but also my notes within Obsidian.
