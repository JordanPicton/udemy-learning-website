                Now moving onto getting data out of the array, I've put data in order into an array, sometimes the order
                doesn't really matter. So when a piece of data is put into an array each element is assigned an index
                value similar to how strings have indices. Just in this case it's the entire piece of data instead of a
                single character. Each element has it's own index, starts off with 0 and then goes upwards. Just like
                the Strings again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The below list shows the index value of the data stored at that index value of an array.
            <ul>
                <li>Index Value [0] - Data Value [Charlie]</li>
                <li>Index Value [1] - Data Value [Suzie]</li>
                <li>Index Value [2] - Data Value [Dexter]</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To get a piece of data out of an array, this works very similar to how you'd get a character out of a
                String, for example with a String it would be something like "Charlie"[2] and the output would be "a"
                because this is the character located at the index of 2. Well this works the same way basically for an
                array, instead of using the String I would just use the variable name for the array I want to data from.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if I had an array like so {let familyPets = ["Charlie", "Suzie", "Dexter"]} and I wanted to
                get the value of index 1 then I would do something like {familyPets[1]} and it would give the output of
                "Suzie". This is because the index starts at 0.
