                A new section! This is slightly weird feeling since I haven't really done this for a while but it's good
                to be here. A new section which is JavaScript Arrays!
            </p>
            <p>
                So beginning with JavaScript Arrays, this is the first data structure that I will be looking at, data
                structure being a collection of data. For example I've used small pieces of data like a singular number
                "2" or a boolean value (true or false) and even Strings. These aren't a collection of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could have as many variables as I want, for example dog1 = Charlie, dog2 = Suzie, and dog3 = Dexter.
                Just because they have dog in the variable name doesn't mean they're connected at all. Arrays will allow
                me to group data together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The arrays would allow me to store a collection of data underneath itself. They're ordered collections
                of values, arrays have a bunch of slots in which data can be put within, but there's an order. So to
                reiterate the two main concepts of an array is 1, a collection of values. 2, it is an ORDERED collection
                of values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the real world Arrays are within every day life and used more than we think. A comment section
                for example, these are a collection of data being the comments being grouped together but they're also
                ordered this can be by the recency of the comment or likes/votes etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another example would be a collection of levels within a game, something simple like Sudoku, where
                there's more levels. This would be ordered by difficulty with the higher levels getting harder etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another example would be songs in a playlist
