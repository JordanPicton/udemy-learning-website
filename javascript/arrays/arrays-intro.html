            <p>
                A new section! This is slightly weird feeling since I haven't really done this for a while but it's good
                to be here. A new section which is JavaScript Arrays!
            </p>
            <p>
                So beginning with JavaScript Arrays, this is the first data structure that I will be looking at, data
                structure being a collection of data. For example I've used small pieces of data like a singular number
                "2" or a boolean value (true or false) and even Strings. These aren't a collection of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could have as many variables as I want, for example dog1 = Charlie, dog2 = Suzie, and dog3 = Dexter.
                Just because they have dog in the variable name doesn't mean they're connected at all. Arrays will allow
                me to group data together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The arrays would allow me to store a collection of data underneath itself. They're ordered collections
                of values, arrays have a bunch of slots in which data can be put within, but there's an order. So to
                reiterate the two main concepts of an array is 1, a collection of values. 2, it is an ORDERED collection
                of values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the real world Arrays are within every day life and used more than we think. A comment section
                for example, these are a collection of data being the comments being grouped together but they're also
                ordered this can be by the recency of the comment or likes/votes etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another example would be a collection of levels within a game, something simple like Sudoku, where
                there's more levels. This would be ordered by difficulty with the higher levels getting harder etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another example would be songs in a playlist as it would be a collection of songs. Representing the
                songs via Strings. They're ordered collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating arrays is pretty simple and I've put examples of this within the connected javascript file. To
                make an array the use of the square brackets "[]" tell the browser that this is going to be an array
                with some data inside or will have data added to it later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Square brackets are used somewhere else which is where we access a character within a String. I've added
                an example again to the connected script file. So with the first example within the script file, it
                assigns a variable to an empty array. Think as like having an empty set of drawers (container).
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the dev tools on most browsers, when looking at an array there's some extra information that can
                be seen when clicking on a little triangle next to the value of the array. For example if the variable
                name is called and it shows the value of the array, there'll be a little triangle that can be interacted
                with.
            </p>
            <p>
                When doing typeof {ArrayVariableName} it will give the output of "object" which is interesting to know
                since well I never knew that an Array was an object. This is good to know because if I try and check
                something to see if it is an array then it will give back object so this is just something to keep in
                mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the arrays that I've created, the items I've put within them are in no particular order but the
                left most item will be the one that gets displayed first. This will be the first item within that list
                and will then follow suit. With the second item being the second one that is right after the first,
                sounds pretty straight forward to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                So if the values aren't really needed to be ordered, they are ordered by how they are positioned within
                the array. Something that I can do with Arrays that I've done before with Strings is using the .length
                property. When using this on an array and not a String, it will give me the amount of values that are
                within the array rather than the amount of characters within the String when used of the Array.
            </p>
            <p>
                So to make the last paragraph a bit more clear, is when length is used on a String, it will give the
                amount of characters within that String. And when used on an Array it will give the amount of items
                within that array.
            </p>
            <p>
                When length is used on an empty array it will give the output of 0 because that's the truth, there is
                nothing within an EMPTY array.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally the last thing to mention is that arrays don't have to be a singular data type, they can be
                mixed with Numbers (and decimals), Strings, Booleans, and Truthy or Falsy values. In some other
                languages they are limited to only one data type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another that can be done within this language is, I can put an array inside of an array. With the up
                coming lessons I'll be looking into accessing the information within a created array, modify, remove,
                add, switch order items within the array.
