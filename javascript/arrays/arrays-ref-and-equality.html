                Moving onto something I wish I didn't have to come back to honestly but here we are. It's the === and ==
                operators. The difference being this will be with arrays instead of Strings or numbers that I've done
                before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've tried an array with the value of ["Hi", "Bye"] and then trying something like ["Hi", "Bye"] ===
                ["Hi", "Bye"] results in false. It looks exactly the same but it's not seen as the same by JavaScript
                and I think this is because it's an array and the way it stores data is different. This also is false if
                the array is [1] === [1] but even [] === [] gives the output of false as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not the only thing though, it seems that doing [1] == [1] also give the output of false, meaning
                both === and == are giving the output of false to arrays that seem like they're the same. But for some
                reason aren't. The reason to why this is giving the false output is because JavaScript doesn't actually
                care for the contents of the array, what it is actually looking for is the references in memory.
