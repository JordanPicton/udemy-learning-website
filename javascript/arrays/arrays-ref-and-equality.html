                Moving onto something I wish I didn't have to come back to honestly but here we are. It's the === and ==
                operators. The difference being this will be with arrays instead of Strings or numbers that I've done
                before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've tried an array with the value of ["Hi", "Bye"] and then trying something like ["Hi", "Bye"] ===
                ["Hi", "Bye"] results in false. It looks exactly the same but it's not seen as the same by JavaScript
                and I think this is because it's an array and the way it stores data is different. This also is false if
                the array is [1] === [1] but even [] === [] gives the output of false as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not the only thing though, it seems that doing [1] == [1] also give the output of false, meaning
                both === and == are giving the output of false to arrays that seem like they're the same. But for some
                reason aren't. The reason to why this is giving the false output is because JavaScript doesn't actually
                care for the contents of the array, what it is actually looking for is the references in memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                When storing a number for later use, which is generally within a variable and when this happens it gets
                stored within memory. Something else to know is that when storing a number like 0.9999999999, there can
                only be so many places before it just gets rounded to 1 or something. I'm not sure if this works with
                other data types but it seems like there's only so many bits of data allowed for these pieces of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                With doing something like let testNumber = 82; think of it storing the memory value of 82 and not really
                for the variable name testNumber. Though I'm not really sure how this fully works honestly. But this
                doesn't work for arrays, instead of trying to associate the content of the array with the variable name,
                instead it stores a reference because arrays can have things added, removed and be changed. JavaScript
                doesn't really remember how many things are in there.
            </p>
            <p>
                So when making an array, it's given it's own address like a street address and you can't have two houses
                within the same space, even apartments of flats have different addresses with 15a and 15b for example.
                So when trying to compare the arrays like [] === [] it won't work because it's technically testing two
                references against each other. Not actually comparing the content of the arrays themselves. Contents of
                the two different arrays can be the same but they don't share the same reference within memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly when doing something like arrayOne = [1, 2, 3]; and arrayOneCopy = arrayOne; will have the
                same reference since the second variable is equal to the first variable which is an array meaning the
                first arrays reference. Even when something is updated to arrayOne, the copy will have the same output
                because it's still the same reference. It doesn't copy over the actual content stored within but it does
                copy the reference, so any manipulation that occurs with arrayOne will be done for the copy as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only reason to compare arrays is to see if they're the same thing as in the same reference within
                memory. It won't help in comparing the contents of the array but there are ways to do this, they're just
                more involved.
