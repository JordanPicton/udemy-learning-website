            <h2>Slice Method</h2>
            <p>
                With the slice method it allows me to basically chop off some of the data I don't want for a specific
                output or use case. For example if I have an array with 100 elements within, but I only want the first
                10 elements then I would be able to slice this section of elements out and output them. However, this is
                not how it works, it turns out slice(10) would actually remove the ONLY the first elements, it doesn't
                single out the number of elements you want from the first index.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead what this does is it counts from the first index to the number that has been specified and
                then it removes those elements instead of using them as an output. For example, imagine having an array
                like so dogs ["Charlie", "Suzie", "Dexter", "Bonny", "Clyde"];. Now using lets try using slice on this
                array. dogs.slice(3); if I was to do something like this then instead of giving the output of "Charlie",
                "Suzie", "Dexter". I would get the output of "Bonny", "Clyde". Where I thought it would give the
                "Charlie", "Suzie", "Dexter" output but this just isn't the case in how it works.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the slice method takes in a number condition to see how many elements it will remove from an array
                starting at the beginning idex of that array. Actually not quite since there's more I can do with this
                method. For instance if I wanted to copy an array to another variable then I can just give the method no
                arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can also select between two indices, meaning if I wanted the elements between 70 and 80 then I would
                have to do something like arrayName.slice(70, 81); the reason why it would have to be 81 is because if I
                wanted to include 80 then I need to go one index up since it doesn't include the second argument index
                itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having no arguments within the method allows you to copy the array elements to another variable. If
                there is one argument then the output will start at that index value of the array and continue until the
                rest of the elements have been output. Whereas when using two arguments the first argument starts and
                includes the element at that index but for the second index it stops but doesn't include the element at
                this index, giving the output of start index to end index -1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Making the argument a negative index will start it from the end of the array instead of the front.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Splice Method</h2>
            <p>
                Moving onto the splice method, okay so this sounds confusing, apparently this has a bit more to it, even
                reading the MDN brief for this is a little confusing. "The splice() method changes the contents of any
                array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place." - MDN. It's a
                little confusing but I'm sure it will make more sense when I actually get on with messing around with
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The syntax for the method is a little weird to use, so the first argument is the index in which I would
                like to start the splice, with the second one being how many things I want to delete. And optionally a
                third one to insert new values if needed. Something to note is that this method is destructive to the
                original array, meaning the output of this method replaces the original array, unless it's a const I
                think.
            </p>
            <p>
                When using splice and removing elements, the returned output is the elements that are being removed from
                the array. These can be saved to a variable if desired. For example, if I was to have a array called
                games with the values ["Zelda", "Sonic", "Spyro", "Fable", "Oblivion"] and I wanted to remove Fable from
                the array. I would have to do something like games.splice(3, 1); This would go to the index value of 3
                which would be Fable and then it would only delete/remove 1 element which would be that index, in this
                case the element which would have the value of Fable. It doesn't go to an index and then delete the next
                indexed element, it deletes the index that it starts from and then counts up depending on the second
                number value.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there's a third argument that can be introduced to this. The way it works is by placing the new
                elements at the index value of the starting value argument. So if the starting value argument was 3 then
                it would start inserting these elements at the index of 3. It's not common to use splice to insert
                content into the middle of arrays as it's not really efficient to do this. It's better to update the end
                of an array whenever possible, but sometimes this can't be avoided. It's useful for removing elements
                from an array,

            <h2>Sort Method</h2>
            <p>
                Finally the sort method, currently it's not going to be as useful as it will be later on but knowing
                about it is good. The default way in which it sorts elements within the array is it compares the
                elements against each other by converting everything into Strings and then compares the UTF-16 codes for
                each of those against each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the default sorting option from the sort method, it does something that I've come across before
                which is where numbers would be converted into Strings and then trying to compare them it would give an
                odd behaviour. This is because when it converts them into Strings it compares the first digit only
                really so if I was to have a bunch of values like: 1, 42, 231, 23124, 7463, 242352, 123412. Then it
                wouldn't look like "1 ,42, 231, 7463, 23124, 123412, 242352" it would give the output of "1, 123412,
                231, 23124, 242352, 42, 7463", which isn't what I'd expect because how is 42 bigger than 231? Well it's
                not, the reason it does this is because instead of checking the actual number value, it's comparing the
                value designated to the character of 1 from the <a
                    href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/charset/UTF-16/list.htm">UTF-16</a> table. And from there
                it's easy to see why it's getting muddled up and not sorted the way I want it to.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's using the binary/encoded value for the character instead of the actual number value, to change
                something into a number it would be something like Number(value/variable); but I'm not sure how this
                works with this array sort method as it is just generally sorted via turning it's values into Strings
                and then comparing them. There's a way to get around this however where I can make functions that can
                order it properly for me (I've learnt a little with functions in college and they're still pretty
                confusing).
            </p>
            <p>
                So for now sort will make more sense later on. There are a lot more other methods that I can try out
                from MDN (Which I probably really should try at some point). For example there's a method that allows me
                to convert an Array to a String but this isn't as common, there are use cases for this but not as much
                as others. With some others just require more knowledge before getting to know.
