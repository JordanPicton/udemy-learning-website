                Moving onto nested Arrays, this basically means I can nest arrays inside other arrays. An example of
                this is shown below.

                With the example nested array above, you can see I've got an external array/container encapsulating some
                other nested/child arrays. When asking for this to be printed out into console the console gives the
                output of: Array (3) [(6)[...], (3) [...], (4) [...] ]. Which basically means that the games array has 3
                items within it however, those items also have content within them. Also with with the brackets in front
                of the square brackets, this is the length or it tells you the amount of items within those nested
                arrays.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've made another example of this within the connected script file. It's perfectly common to use nested
                arrays, especially in the sense of game boards. To retrieve items from within a nested array all I need
                to do is chain square brackets like variableName[indexValue(0,1,2,3...)][indexValue(0,1,2,3...)].
