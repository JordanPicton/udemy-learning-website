                So with this lesson, I'll be learning a more array methods but I won't be going into too much depth
                about them. But they're still good to learn about.
            </p>

            <h2>Concat Method</h2>
            <p>
                With concat, which is short for concatenation. Well I've used with this Strings and it basically adds
                one String to another. So I'll have a little guess as to what this would do with an array. And well the
                only thing I can think of is that it adds and array to another. Meaning it mergers one array set of data
                with another.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I tested this method within the connected JavaScript file and it does work as I thought, to do this I
                made some test arrays. Then I made another array (array3) with the value of array1.concat(array2). And
                that's all it took to get these arrays to work together. Meaning that array3 would be the combination of
                array1 + array2. And that's the basic gist of how concat works. With array1 being first, all the
                elements within array1 will be in the new array first before the array2 elements will start from the end
                of array1 which would normally be empty but in this new array these elements are filled from array2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using concat does not alter any of the original arrays but can be saved to a new array/variable.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Includes Method</h2>
            <p>
                So includes is a boolean, so when using this method on an array, it searches the array for the value
                inputted and if it's found then it's classed as true, whereas if the value isn't found then it's classed
                as false.
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes more sense when used within something like an IF statement due to how it works, you can check
                IF something INCLUDES something and if it does then it would be classed as true and if not then it would
                be false.
