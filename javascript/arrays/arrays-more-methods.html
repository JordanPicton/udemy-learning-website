                So with this lesson, I'll be learning a more array methods but I won't be going into too much depth
                about them. But they're still good to learn about.
            </p>

            <h2>Concat Method</h2>
            <p>
                With concat, which is short for concatenation. Well I've used with this Strings and it basically adds
                one String to another. So I'll have a little guess as to what this would do with an array. And well the
                only thing I can think of is that it adds and array to another. Meaning it mergers one array set of data
                with another.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I tested this method within the connected JavaScript file and it does work as I thought, to do this I
                made some test arrays. Then I made another array (array3) with the value of array1.concat(array2). And
                that's all it took to get these arrays to work together. Meaning that array3 would be the combination of
                array1 + array2. And that's the basic gist of how concat works. With array1 being first, all the
                elements within array1 will be in the new array first before the array2 elements will start from the end
                of array1 which would normally be empty but in this new array these elements are filled from array2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using concat does not alter any of the original arrays but can be saved to a new array/variable.
            </p>

            <h2>Includes Method</h2>
            <p>
                So the Includes method is a boolean, so when using this method on an array, it searches the array for
                the value inputted and if it's found then it's classed as true, whereas if the value isn't found then
                it's classed as false.
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes more sense when used within something like an IF statement due to how it works, you can check
                IF something INCLUDES something and if it does then it would be classed as true and if not then it would
                be false.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've tested this and it works the way I think it does.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>IndexOf Method</h2>
            <p>
                This method is very similar to how the IndexOf works with a String. For example if I was to have a
                String "Hello" and used the IndexOf on that String like so "Hello".indexOf("e") then the output value
                would be 1 since the index starts at the number 0 and this spot would be taken by the character "H".
                Searching for a character that's not within that String would give the value of -1 because it's not
                there.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems when using this method on an array that I may have to use the full piece of data rather than
                just a section of it however, I'll test this out in the script file. It has to be the exact value that
                you'd expect within the array. So for example Pig within the array list called animals works just as
                good as I'd expect it to work. But when looking for Duty part within Call of Duty in the games array
                list, this doesn't work and I can tell by the value it gives which is -1 meaning it's not found, it's
                not present.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an easy way to find out if something is within a certain array or not. IF (condition) is equal
                to -1 then it's not located within this array.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something else to note about this is that I can start it from a different index if I wanted other than
                0, this has nothing to do with the IF statement I was just talking about. But if I wanted to do this
                then it would look like so arrayName.indexOf("Test", 4); in this case the indexOf would start looking
                FROM index 4 and then onwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will only show the first instance of the asked for value condition, just like it would for a String. Can
                also tell if something is in an array or not but can also tell you where the first instance of that
                value will be shown first.
            </p>

            <h2>Reverse Method</h2>
            <p>
                With this method I believe it will reverse the order of the array list for example with the cars array
                list in the script file that looks like "Toyota", "Nissan", "Vauxhall", "BMW", "Tesla", "Ford" by
                default, I believe it to look like "Ford", "Tesla", "BMW", "Vauxhall", "Nissan", "Toyota" with the
                reverse method. (I'm going to double check with both the video and a test like normal.)
            </p>
            <p>
                It does exactly what I thought it would do. However, be careful when using this because it is
                destructive meaning when using this on the array, it changes the original array.
            </p>
            <p>
                With methods, they usually want some form of condition within their parenthesis, but for the reverse
                method this isn't needed. Bare minimum those parenthesis need to be there but can be empty, just note
                that a lot of the methods do require something to be between them.
