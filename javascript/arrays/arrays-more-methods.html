                So with this lesson, I'll be learning a more array methods but I won't be going into too much depth
                about them. But they're still good to learn about.

            <h2>Concat Method</h2>
            <p>
                With concat, which is short for concatenation. Well I've used with this Strings and it basically adds
                one String to another. So I'll have a little guess as to what this would do with an array. And well the
                only thing I can think of is that it adds and array to another. Meaning it mergers one array set of data
                with another.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I tested this method within the connected JavaScript file and it does work as I thought, to do this I
                made some test arrays.
