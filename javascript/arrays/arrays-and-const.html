            <p>
                I've looked at constants before with Strings and how they don't allow for manipulation with the original
                data. An example would be const testOne = "Hello"; then trying to do something like testOne = "Not
                Hello";. However with arrays this doesn't work the same as you can actually change the const value with
                arrays.
            </p>
            <p>
                With arrays and consts you're able to change the contents of the array but with the outer
                shell/reference you can't change this as this is the actual part const cares about. So think of this
                like a box, you can change the inside of the box, but you can't change the outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I can use all the methods I've learnt recently on the array as long as the address of the array stays
                the same then the const won't error. Things like push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice, and sort can
                be used to manipulate the array as long as the address stays the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something like const myEggs = ['brown', 'brown'] is fine to set the array and then adding to the array
                with push like myEggs.push('purple') will add the element purple at the end of the array. myEggs[1] =
                'orange' this would change our array to look like 'brown', 'orange', 'purple'. But trying to do
                something like myEggs = ['blue', 'pink'] would not work, because the array has already been defined
                meaning the address is already here. Trying to change the array like this will run into an error.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using const with arrays might not work the same way I would expect as it would with strings. It might
                act a bit funky in regards to how it works with arrays compared to strings. You can change the inside
                but not the reference.
