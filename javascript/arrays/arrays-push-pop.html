                Moving onto Array methods, the first two I'll be looking into are called push and pop. A basic
                understanding of how these work are push adds to the end of the array whilst pop removes the last
                element within the array.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like Strings that come with a bunch of their own built in methods which can be view via writing the
                String and then putting a period at the end to have a look and see what is available. Arrays also come
                with their own methods which can be viewed in the same way but instead of using just the array itself I
                would use the variable name for the array and this can also be done for Strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                MDN has a good documentation regarding the Array methods and String methods. There's a standard built-in
                objects for a various amount of different things within JavaScript.

            <h2>Push Method</h2>
            <p>
                So first up the push method, this adds data to the very end of the array that has already got defined
                values. It won't add something to the index of 999 unless there was an element or piece of data defined
                within index value 998.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again examples are in the linked script file. When using a method on a String the method doesn't
                actually alter the original String, for example the toUpperCase method when used on a String like so dog
                = "Charlie", dog.toUpperCase() = "CHARLIE" but dog would still have the value of "Charlie".
            </p>
            <p>
                However, when using the push method on the array, it actually changes the array to keep that new piece
                of data stored within. Instead of writing the entire list out when using the push method the value given
                back when doing this in console is the length of the new array list. Just to show it has actually been
                updated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something cool that can be done with the push method is that more than one piece of data can be added to
                the array at a time, removing the need to type out the array variable and then the method with the piece
                of data to be added every time. So instead of doing arrayVariable.push("data1");
                arrayVariable.push("data2");. The simpler method would be to just do something like
                arrayVariable.push("data1", "data2"); Removing the need to write out redundant code for adding more than
                one piece of data.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Pop Method</h2>
            <p>
                Now moving onto the pop method, it does the opposite of push, in regards to adding data. With this
                method it removes data at the end of the array. So the last defined value gets removed from the array
                list. There's also no need to do anything with the pop method like the push method. The push method
                requires some condition between it's brackets but with the pop method this isn't used since it's
                defaulted to just remove the last value so they can just be empty.
            </p>
            <p>
                What this does it when using this on the array like arrayVariable.pop() (lets say the arrayVariable
                array has the values of "data1", "data2", "data3") it will give the value of the element or piece of
                data it's going to remove so for example in this case it would say "data3" but not only that. The
                element or piece of data called "data3" will also be removed from the array. Now it doesn't actually
                give the output of data3, it only does this when using it within console.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though after using pop on the example above, it would now have "data1", "data2" stored in the array,
                with "data3" no longer being there due to it being removed with pop. Something else I can do with this
                though is say I wanted to save that piece of data that got removed from the array, then I could do
                something like dataVariable = arrayVariable.pop(), this would then save the removed element/data into a
                new variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a different example to show why using both push and pop in conjunction could be useful. There are
                some use cases where we would want to remove something that just got added into the array, it's not
                always like a queue where the first thing in line is the first one to get out, there are computer
                science concepts called stack and queue which are things I don't need to worry about right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just to touch up on those concepts that we don't need to know right now, push, pop, shift and unshift
                come from the traditional computer science structures, stack and a queue. Think of this being a stack,
                like a stack of papers on a desk, you pull one from the top of the stacking, being the most recently
                added one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Push being add to the top and pop being remove from the top. So the example was to basically put it into
                context of when going to the gym and putting weights onto the barbell, normally the bigger ones go on
                the inside and to take them off you need to take all the other ones off before hand and this works the
                same here. Before removing an element that is towards the start, you need to remove the ones towards the
                end before getting back to the start.
