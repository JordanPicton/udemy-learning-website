                Moving onto Array methods, the first two I'll be looking into are called push and pop. A basic
                understanding of how these work are push adds to the end of the array whilst pop removes the last
                element within the array.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like Strings that come with a bunch of their own built in methods which can be view via writing the
                String and then putting a period at the end to have a look and see what is available. Arrays also come
                with their own methods which can be viewed in the same way but instead of using just the array itself I
                would use the variable name for the array and this can also be done for Strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                MDN has a good documentation regarding the Array methods and String methods. There's a standard built-in
                objects for a various amount of different things within JavaScript.

                So first up the push method, this adds data to the very end of the array that has already got defined
                values. It won't add something to the index of 999 unless there was an element or piece of data defined
                within index value 998.

                Again examples are in the linked script file.
