/* With the box model for CSS it's then idea of that everything in CSS is a box and  those boxes have properties. This is due to when you look at different elements that are styled with CSS, since the CSS code is only styling it and not the actual foundation,
then when you look at it via the dev tools within the browser you can see that there are sat inside boxes and it doesn't matter if you have rounded edges etc. It will still show a box due to HTML being mostly in boxes and that's what the CSS uses but it just
makes them look pretty. At least this is my understanding of how this works. 
Also when using the dev tools on an element you can see there's different colours either all the time, sometimes or most of the time. These are to indicate different properties about that element. I kind of suspected this and I was correct, it's showing the properties of,
the content itself, margin, padding and border. I didn't really think one would be border but it's good to know.

Width, is one of the properties that controls the width of an element on a page, lets say you only want an img element to be 200px across then I would set the property of img within CSS to 200px and it would only be 200px on that page. The img would still be the
original height due to not setting that property but it works within a very similar way. By default the property of width sets the width of the content area but there is a way to make it set the width of a border area which we'll learn about later.
With the example below we are setting the width of the section elements to a width of 500px, there are other measurements we can use but we haven't covered these yet.

Using the dev tools within the browser, I'm using Firefox Developer Edition, when I hover over the section element that I just changed I can see a blue box which represents the content of that element.
We can do the same with height, if we make height too small then it will squish all the content together and it will overlap.

So something to note, the container I'm using below which is section will grow even though I've restrcited the container to be 100px in height this is because with this being a block container. I've just understood it though and it's going to be annoying to explain
but here I go. Basically the height only dictates the amount of space it takes on the page and doesn't dictate how much space the content is actually give, so it will overlap content but if the content has more content than what the height allows it will increase in size
to make sure it is showing off all the content it has within. So it will move an element over another but it won't squish it's own text. I'm still not 100% about this however and I would have to get to use it more to fully understand this.

Something else to note is that originally I was using p element within a section element and it had some default padding which might have been messing with me understanding this a little better. */
section {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}

/* When an element doesn't have a width or a height, and is given something like a background colour. You get a representation of why they're called block elements. It's because the element takes up a chunk of the page and you can see this with the example below
it has a pink background and even though the text stops the background colour contines for the rest of the element and to the end of the block element. It draws the pink backgorund to the edge of the screen. */
h1 {
  background-color: pink;
}
/* As for the example below here you can see when you give a similar looking element with a width property you can see it is only dragged out to the set width. In this case it's 60px so the background colour will stop at 60px. However, if you look at the element with the
browser development tools you can still see the element going across the entire page because we're not changing the element itself. We're just styling the content and how the element looks. */
h2 {
  background-color: chartreuse;
  width: 60px;
}

/* The next thing is borders and there's a lot we can do with these, for example we can change the style of a border being a solid line, dotted etc. Along with colour, size and curved or not. There's a border property but then there's a bunch of border related
properties, like I said in the sentence before we can do all of that and that's why there are a bunch of border related properties. There's even border properties to control a specific section of a border, for example the left side or right side and top and bottom 
each one of these can be controlled individually or all together. 
This is pretty exaplanitory within itself, it's the border around the element. They're pretty common and used to bring attention to a specific piece of content or used to show what belongs together.

The main border properties I'll be learning are these three; border-width, border-color and border-style.
The live examnple below shows that the element with the id name of "one" will have a border width of 5px and the px measurement is usually common here since in this case borders are pretty small anyway.
Also something to remember is that when setting a border width, you can't see the border itself because it doesn't have a colour. I also tested if it would show a border when using a different background colour for the entire document and it doesn't.
Even after setting the border color we don't see anything this is because I would need to set the border style as well. I think if I left out the width however, I would see a default thickness of the border which I don't know currently. I tested this and it does, if
I do not have a width set there is a default one already there.

As seen from the live example the border goes right up next to the content but doesn't cover the content. This also does shift this specific element over by 10 pixels as this is what I have asked for within the border width. Since there's 5 pixels on either side, this
means that the element has an extra 10 pixels than it would have if it didn't have the border.
Since we set all section elements to be 200x200 above this means that the section element with the id of one is actually 210x210 because we have added the border to it as shown below. 
Using the box-sizing property it will make the border be the exact size we set above which was 200px by 200px and this can be seen with the page. The text runs over to the element below. But I've disabled it for now, when using this it sets the element to go from border
to border rather than having the border placed ontop of the content area. So instead of having 200x200 for the content area we would have 190x190. This way can be easier because you can set the width of the entire element including the border. */
#one {
  background-color: red;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-color: black;
  border-style: solid;
  /* box-sizing: border-box; */
}

/* With beneath we're messing around with, the style of the border along with the way we can style different pieces of the border.
For example we're setting the border below to have a dashed style along with changing only the left side of the border to be a dark red colour. 
We can do something kind of cool or interesting at least. Starting from the top and then going in a clock-wise fashion I can change each style of the border by using something like below:
border-style: solid; - Makes a solid border around the entire element.
border-style: solid dashed dotted; - This will make the top border solid, and then the right border dashed, along with the bottom border being dotted and finally since I didn't add a 4th one, which I could have, the left border would also be a solid border.
We have also increased the left side of the border to be 8px wide were as the rest of the border will still be using 3px. */
#two {
  background-color: blueviolet;
  border-color: orange;
  border-width: 3px;
  border-style: dashed;
  border-left-color: darkred;
  border-left-width: 8px;
}

/* Below is the more common way of doing borders, using the border short hand allows us to do things like the width, colour and style in one property. Typically people provide the thickness, style and colour of the border within this short hand.
It's also common to have other short hand properties but we'll learn about those more later. Short hands basically allow for setting multiple properties within one go and there will be others we see in the future.
If I wanted to change something on a different side of the border example below which I'll be personally using more of than the other ones honestly. Then all I need to do is similar to what I have done above, using border-left or right, top, or bottom then I can change
the property of what I want to be different. For example underneath I'll set the right side to be dotted and thicker.

The border radius element below is used to round off the corners of the border. There's a lot to this and there's a good reference which is shown here: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29966499/border-radius-in-percentage-and-pixels-px-or-em 
Apparently using the percentage method which makes it more of an oval for a rectangle shape, when it's a square shape and you have the percentage used instead of the pixel measurement. You can make a circle and it's commonly used to have a pciture
inside this circle and there's way to get the content within this circle.
You can also make it so that you can round just one or a few corners depending on the use case. It's very similar to the border properties where it has a short hand or you can use the specific properties. */
#three {
  background-color: yellow;
  /* width style colour */
  border: 4px groove turquoise;
  border-right-width: 6px;
  border-right-style: dotted;
  border-radius: 10%;
}

/* Padding, okay so what this is, is basically the spacing between the actual content and the box/container that the content is inside of. Think of it in the same sense of an actual physical object for example an item you want to ship, you have the item
or content you want to ship and then you have the box it's in but if it's fragile you use padding like bubble wrap, and that's what padding is, it's the bubble wrap.
Just like some other properties there is a short hand and then more specific properties we can use for padding for example if we want to be specific and change the padding of only one side then we would use this "padding-<sidename>" and for the short
hand, you guessed it, it's just padding (this will set all four sides at once however).
You can use the dev tools again to see this in action for example with FireFox Development Edition when I hover over an element I can see the element and the blue box is the content of the element but the padding colour is a light purple which
almost looks like a darker blue.
With the example below we're adding space between the border and the content, the element doesn't need to be given an actual border within CSS for this, it's just the edge of the container the element has. */
h1 {
  padding-left: 100px;
}

/* And with the example below we've added padding around the entire second paragraph or I should say the ID of "two" element. It's pretty commonly used and helps spacing things out nicely along with making things seem larger then they actually are.
It just looks better. It's useful since you can make an element take more space without making the content inside it any bigger than you already have it.

Some interesting stuff to note:
  Applies to all four sides - padding: 10px;  <--- Common
  vertical then horizontal - padding: 5px 10px;   <--- Uncommon
  top then horizontal then bottom - padding: 1px 2px 2px;   <--- Rare
  top then right then bottom then left - padding: 5px 1px 0 2px;   <---Common */
#two {
  padding: 30px;
}

/* Margin, this is the spacing on the OUTSIDE of an elements border so it's the space between the selected element and the other element(s). Just like padding we have the 4 different individual properties being; "margin-<sidename>" and then the
short hand of "margin". This is also useful for when you don't want elements of pieces of content touching but you don't want to add a blank element for white space, you can just add a margin.
In the developer tools of FireFox Developer Edition this shows up as the yellow section of an element when hovering over it with the inspector tools.
By default a bunch of elements will have margin and some default values assigned, even the body element has a default margin value and a lot of people generally remove it so the content goes across the entire page, and if they need to add it back in later
then it's easier to just add it where you need it. */
body {
  margin: 0;
}

/* With the example below we give the element with the selector id of one a margin to the left side of it to be 50 pixels. Along with a margin to the bottom being 20 pixels. */
#one {
  margin-left: 50px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Below sets the margin to be 200 pixels around the entire element with the id of two. This is the short hand method where it sets all sides. Very similar to padding in that regard. */
#two {
  margin: 200px;
}

/* Below shows the movement of the span within the H2 element that we want to move. We can move it to the left but if I try moving it up or down it won't work, I'll be learning how to do this next. */
span {
  margin-left: 30px;
  margin-top: 40px;
}

/* Display property,  */
