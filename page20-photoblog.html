      <!-- Okay so something I noticed when writing this out myself is that when I have the images wrote on a new line, instead of being wrote on the same line and having the software collapsing the text, it breaks the site slightly in the sense there is extra
      padding or margin somewhere because of the space between the elements. Turns out there's a really anooying thing with HTML where there is white space when moving to the next line when doing something like this meaning that HTML is accounting for an
      invisible character basically. 
      
      So think of doing something like: <span>Hello</span><span>World</span> It would look like HelloWorld 
      Where as if I did it like this:
      <span>Hello</span>
      <span>World</span>
      It would look like this: Hello World
      Kind of weird this wasn't taught earlier on and honestly just very weird to begin with. However when we get to flexbox this won't be an issue. -->
